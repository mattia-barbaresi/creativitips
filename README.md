# Segmentation and Chunking

## ...using Transitional Quantities, and Parser-like mechanisms for attention

____________________________

### Some key parameters that alter results the most:

- **fogetting**
- **memory activation**
- **interference**
- the size of data:
    - for a short-term memory, a lot of (different) data create messy representations.

### TODOs:

- manage first item segmentation (e.g., 'mer' â†’ 'm' + 'er' )
- TPS:
    - form symbols to units (generalization, abstraction)
    - calculating tps with interference, not with softmax(normalized)

### What's next?

- abstraction
- state uncertainty
- bimodal integration

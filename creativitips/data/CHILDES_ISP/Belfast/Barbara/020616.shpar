unless || shes || crying || her eyes || out
you || know || the old story
but || generally || she doesnt
you || see || shes || very good

shell || be || up || out || of || the bed
and || then || shell || start wandering || about
well || the bed || that || we || had
the end || of || the stairs || my stairs || are || very steep

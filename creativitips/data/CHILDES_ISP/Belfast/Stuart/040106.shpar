because || the children || are || at || school
I || thought || maybe || you || were going || out || today
but || then || I || saw || him || heading || out || to || nursery
well || at || nursery || he || was || a brilliant boy wasnt || he
hes || brilliant || at || the minute
youll hafta || let || me || see || it || when || youve || finished
you || can look || at || it || now || if || you || like
when || we || first || seen || it || up || at || the top || come || on || to || you || see || it
part || of || it || was running || off
and || I || stripped || four bits || off
just || like || a twist || like || the one || in || our bedroom
thatll || be || lovely

Ill || do || forty || five minutes || of || this || with || him
and || then || Ill || leave || this || with || you
and || you || can do || the other side
and || Jane || could || you || remember to put || the microphone || on || this time
laughs
laughs
he || probably || has || a better idea || of || how || to do || it || than || I || have
I || mean || I || done || it || the last time || okay
I dont || know || what || I || done
Jane Ive || done || it || as || many times || myself
and not everybody || is || as convenient || as || you
what || did || you || put || on || the lawn Missus
Greensward
I || seen || you || up || down || with || the wee trolley
www
it || was || Greensward || you || put || on || ours wasnt || it || out || the back
the other night || I || was talking || to || him || about || it
and || then || I || went || down || to || the garden centre || on || the Doagh Road
and || I || was asking || them || about || an applicator
so || the woman || says || youd hafta || use || the Stuarts one
because || its || for || granular
yeah
the Bio one || is || for || powder
right
so || I || goes || right || over || thirty five pounds
heres || me || bloody sure
Im not || giving || thirty five pounds || for || an old trough || you || use || once
I || come || home || looked || up || the Argos book || right enough
youd || get || them || cheaper || than || that
and || there || was || one || at || nine pounds ninety nine || something || like || that
and || I || was || in || B || Q || the other morning || for || a brush
and || I || just || happened to look || at || the gardening stuff
and || they || had || one
it || was || Fisons
and || it || was || about || a tenner || in || B and Q
well || we || were || actually || on || our way || down || to get || one
www
well || the one || at || the back || was done || about six weeks || ago
but || its a bit patchy
Im sure Steven || would lend || it || to || you
oh aye
I || was just going to feed || the front lawn
and || your man || says feed || the front lawn || leave || it || for || a week
and || then || you || can sow || grass seed
did || you || get || the grass seed
uhhuh
did || you || get || it
how much || you || get
I || got || twenty five pound
whats || that || like
is || it || enormous
its || like || a sack || of || potatoes
well || said || he || would take || some
aye sure
well || I dont || need || the whole lot
how much || was || it
twelve and a half kilos || thirty || four quid
but || its roughly about one thirty four || a pound
but || I || got || some || so that || whoever || wanted || some || could have || it
I || think || Stevenll || be looking || for || some as well
he || said || to || me || last night || he || was going to try to see || the gardeners
see || the gardeners || are || in || that bottom house || today
aye theyre || working || way || at || it
but || he || said || is || that || the minimum || you || can buy
I || says || I || think || Steven || theres || a five kilo bag
but || Id || rather || have had || a wee bit || too much than not enough
so essentially || its || the front || the side || are || the baldy ones
the back ones || too bad
but || Ill || get || them || all || sowed
so || you || can have || half a bag || if || you || want
well || see || about || it
all I || do || is cut || it
youre good
our gardens || coming || up || too bad
hell || buy || whatever || off || you
come || on || you || for || Cathy hasta || do || her business

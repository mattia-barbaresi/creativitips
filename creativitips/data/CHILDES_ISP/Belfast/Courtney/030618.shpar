uhhuh
I wouldnt mind || not having || meat || in || it
but || he || really || likes
you || see || we || dont || eat || a lot || of || vegetables
oh yes yes
so || we || prefer || meat || anyway
well || our children wont || eat || vegetables || you || know || so
maybe a few peas
so || I || feel || I || needta || get || something || into || them
well carrots || that
these two eat carrots || that
but || the likes oh cauliflower
then || I dont || eat || them || either
but || every so || often || I || buy || them || to try || it

oh
because || they || need || very lean meat
oh yes yes
to put || in || them || they || dont || use British beef
they || actually || use || their meat || from || Germany
gosh
and || the small bit || of || gelatin || that || is || in || it || is || from || Italy
gosh
so || theres || no British beef
oh
they || dont || use
this || is || Heinz and Farleys
oh thats || interesting
so || theyre || perfectly || alright || to eat

because || on || Saturday || I || went || out || I || bought || him chicken ones
see || I || would give || themins || you || know || spaghetti || Bolognese || that
well || I || would yes || so || I
oh || oh
I || would do || a lot || of || that and ours || like || like || shepherds pie || really
I || know like mince || is || a handy thing || for

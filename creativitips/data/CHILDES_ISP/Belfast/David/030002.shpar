Denver || thats || just || the terror
I dont || know || where || I || got || him || from
I || told || you
David || was || so different
he || was || so
I || mean
I || said || to || Stuart
how || I || going to cope
hes || only || a year
I || told || you || what || he || was || like
you || see
I || told || you || that || he || was || good
I || know
and || you || never || believed || me
I || said || hes || a really good child
you || never || had || any problems
apart || from || him || sleeping
thats || true
can || I || have || that piece || a minute
you || never || had || any bother || with || him
I || didnt
do || you || remember || I || said || to || you || one day
I || said
does || he || never || lose || his temper || with || you
and || you || said || no
ah
does || that child || never || go
Mummy || I || dont
you || know
he || doesnt
now || hes || had
no but || honestly
you || would not believe || it || was || him
do || you || know || what || it || was
it || was coming || up || to || his birthday
and || a week || after || his birthday
now || I dont || know || whether || it || was || all the attention || on || Denver
and || my mum and dad || all || was || away || Linda
he || had || nobody || to give || him || attention
you || know
the temper
oh the temper
my next door neighbor
couldnt || believe || it || was || him
three doors || down || heard him
so || when || he || does || it || he || does || it || in || style
I || just || lift || him
and || put || him || up || to || his room || just put || him || there
it || takes || you || to do || something || like || that
but || Cathy || he || kicked || the door || put || a hole || in || the door
he || was throwing || things || stamping
and || he || started hitting || the wee boy || next door
the wee boy || next door || is || eight
but || he || started really being || nasty || to || him
and || its not || like || him
Im || going to get || my ball
but nobody || believed || me || that || it || was || him
David
what
here
Ruth || says || I || cant || believe || him
I cant || believe || thats || him
see || hes || always || so quiet
hes || always
hes || generally || a very passive wee boy || really || isnt || he || like
hes awful good
and || hes || no bother
no || hes
laughs
but || this one
youre || going to be || a different story
you || wanna || see || his temper || now
oh || he || is
see || them || two
David || would shout || at || him || to be || quiet
and || stop throwing || a tantrum
and || he || squeals || even || harder
here
and || its harder
do || you || think || its harder
but || when || you || got || the second one || like || that || then
I || know
I || need || that bit
I || had
Adam || was || the worst
you || know || he || was
he || never || slept
and || he useta || throw || himself || down || all
I || was expecting to be || exactly the same
yes || I || know
and || although || you laugh || at || Kathryn
like || shes || easy
shes || no bother
ahhah
she || just || does || everything || so easily || you || know
she || just || breezes || through
and || I didnt || understand || how || it || was to have || another one || like
see || if || it || hadve been || the other way round
I || know
I || thought || you || know

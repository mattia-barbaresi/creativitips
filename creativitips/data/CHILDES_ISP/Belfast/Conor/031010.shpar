Bill || apparently || has measured || up || right out || to || the utility room
but || were || over || two boxes || short || another fifteen pound
and || I || says || to || him
were going to put || a wooden floor || down || the || in || hall
its a lifetime job Cathy
but || its dear
I || says || to || Bill
the tiles || I || want || for || there || were || like || green
I || said
slate || they || were || like || a green and
wherere || you || doing || them || then
I || was going to put || them || down || here
but || we || brought || them || down
and || they || looked
and || that || was || horrible || together || Cathy
so || I || says
were going || to || hafta || go || for || that or something natural
so || I || says || to || Bill || then || last night
what || about || tiling || the hall
thatd || be || stupid || tiling || your hall
see || the dog Cathy || in and || out || mud
I || put || runners || up || the hallway
we || should have just put || carpet

have || you
I || have done || very well
but || funnily enough || that || was || just || what || we || were talking || about || like
and || we || wanted to put || a wooden floor || down
it || is || expensive isnt || it
Cathy I || mean || its a lifetime job
but || I || mean || if || youve || a thousand odd || to spare || I || mean

God forbid something || would come || up || you || know

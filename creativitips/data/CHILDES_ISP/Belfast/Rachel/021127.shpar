even || with || these last minute packages || you || can get
I || know
I || know
but || I || dont know || if || Id || really || fancy going away being || pregnant
yeah
you dont || just || feel || one hundred || per || cent
yes but || normally || I dont || have || the urge || to go || abroad || at all
you || know || anywhere would

my brother || in || law
oh thats handy isnt || it
yes || yes
my brother || in || law || did || it || for || us || so || he || did
so hes || pretty reasonable
he || does || it || more || as || a favor || than || for || the money || really || you || know
well || Im sure || you || werent feeling || like || anything || anyway || you || know
but || it || looks || as if || youve || done
well || Peter || he || would normally do || it
but || he || just || hasnt got || any time || you || know
would || he || normally || go || away || like || that || to
uhhuh
work || away
uhhuh its || just || um || different courses || that
oh
I || think || his firms || actually || you || know based || you || know || in || the main
oh || really
so || thats || why
gosh || so || he || was || ten days
uhhuh
thats || a long time || to be || away || isnt || it
it || is
especially || when || youre || not feeling || well
its awful
its a real nightmare
I wouldnt || have minded || if || we || hadnt have had || the builders || in
we || could have done || that fireplace || all
oh youve || had || a
I || didnt || notice
yeah yeah || we || got || a new fireplace || put || in || as well
oh thats || lovely
its || really nice
that || is || super
are || you || going to get
why || dont || you || get || out || one || of || your dollies
would || you || like to get || one || of || your dollies
and || then || we || could give || the dolly || an injection || take || its
you || a good girl
would || you || like || me || to read || you || a story
will || I || read || you || a story
thats || because || she || has been || awake || from || before seven oclock || this
och || has || she
so || have || you || been || awake || since || before || seven
yes shes || doing || that || every morning || now
oh || is || she
uhhuh
oh gosh
and || Im sure || you || dont feel || like || getting || up
well || Im || too bad || actually
whee
I || go || to || my bed || at || nine oclock || every day anyhow
but || it || doesnt || really || matter
I dont || get || up || until || half eight || like
so || shes || fine
from || seven oclock || she || just || plays || like
yes thats || right || yes
watches || tv
theres quite good tv || in || the mornings isnt || there
Patrick || would be || an early riser too as well
he || goes and wakes || Rob
but || I dont || think || he || has || very good patience
are || you || going to see || how || your mother || is
do || you wanna
do || you wanna
do || you || wanna be || the doctor || for || your mother
what || you || do || is hang || it || round || you || like || that
and || walk || around || like || that
do || you || ever || see || doctors || in || Casualty || with || one || of || them || on || Rachel
yes || like || that || you || see
just || hang || it || round || you || like || that
just || like || the doctors || in || Casualty || do || dont || they
I || havent tried || that
but || sometimes || you || can actually
these ones || do || work
you || can listen || to || your heart
you || can put || that || in || your ears || like || that
can || you || hear || anything
Patrick || got || a doctors kit || just going || into || hospital
right
I || got || it || for || him || a few years || ago
he || got || a doctors kit || for || Christmas
and || he || could do || everything
is || that right
he || was taking || my blood pressure || doing || injections
its amazing || what || they || can pick || up || you || know
so || will || Peter || take || a fortnight || off || for || the twelfth or + ..
um I || think || he || will probably just get || the days || really
he wouldnt || take || his holidays || then
um || we || sort || of || hafta stay
because || I || want || him || to get || a whole lot || of
because || thats || when || the babys || due
Christmas || oh
the seventeenth uhhuh
oh || really
so || he || will hafta take || time || off || work || whenever || I || am || actually || in
then || time || off || work || when || I || come || home || you || know
so || hell hafta || save || as much as possible || until || then
so || have || you || had || a scan
no || just || the first one
just the mini one
but || I || havent || had || the one || where || they || give || the photo || out || home yet
oh || do || you || get || one
yes || you || do
oh || do || you
yes
oh || we || never || got || one
they || give || you || a big scan || you || can have || a photo
ah thats || lovely
but yes || I || had || one || at || twelve or eleven weeks || last week
yes yes || so || its || really || a thrill || that || you || have || a scan isnt || it
thats || right
I || know || it || looks || like || a baby
yeah || its || exciting
yeah I || really || believe || that || theres || only one there
because || Peters daddys || a twin
and || I || always || thought || you || know || with || me || being || so sick
because || you || know || a few times || when || I || was || even sicker || with || Rachel
I || thought || + " /
oh no || I || hope || its not twins
twins || are || lovely
but || I || wouldnt || like || to look || after || them
right
I || wouldnt even mind || the first time
but || definitely || when || youve || already || got || one
and || youre only planning || on || having || one more
one || of || Patricks friends mum um shes || got || two boys
and || shes || expecting || twins
um || shes || only about eight weeks || at || the moment
but || shes || been || so ill
she I || mean || she || can do || nothing
and || she || is constantly feeling || dreadful
I || feel || sorry || for || her
at || the same time shes || glad
because || there || was || a five year gap || between || the youngest one
and || she || says || at least || theyll || be || company || for || each other
yeah
she || says || + " /
I dont || know || how || Im || going to make || it || through
ah
the first couple || of || months || can be || terrible
getting || up || to feed || one baby || in || the night
can || I || put || a sticking plaster || on || you
have || you || got || + ..
yeah
oh
have || you || got || a plaster || on
are || they || good || at || the hospital || here
theyre || going to go || down || to
the Ulster yeah uhhuh || its good
theyre nice
theyre || really || nice
thats || where || you || had || Rachel
yes
are || any || of || the doctors || the midwives || the same
or || they || be || different
no no different
even || when || I || went || with || Rachel || the first time || you || hardly || got
yeah
though || youre || under || a particular consultant
but || I dont || think || Ive || ever || seen || him || at all
oh || really
um || this doctor || I || had || this time || was || really really || nice
I || would really like to see || him || again
he || was || very good
oh yeah yes
he || reckons || I || had || a Caesarean Section || with || Rachel
did || you || oh
because || she || was || breach
eh || though || he || reckons || I || have || a seventy five || to || eighty || per || cent
oh great
because || it || was || just a Caesarean Section
though || Im || wondering
because || she || was lying || in || a really funny position
I || mean || they || couldnt || tell
but || those nurses || must be || able || to tell || if || its breach || just || by
yes || yes
but || every time || they || felt || my stomach || they || said || Im || convinced
and || they || actually || hadta || give || me || a || scan || the morning || of || the section
yeah || so || I dont || think || it || was actually breach
I || think || it || might have been transferred || to || lying || across || that way
so || Im || wondering || if || it || was || anything || to do || with || the shape || of || my womb
because || she || was || never || in || the proper position
but || they || said || in || the hospital || that || they || didnt know || that || they'd
and || just || aim || for || a normal delivery
and || see || what || happens || from || now || to || then
yes
I || thought || maybe || when || they || did || the section || maybe || they || would have
but theyd sort || of || indicated || it || was || my womb
yeah
but || then theres lots || of || people || who || do have || a breach || then || have
och thats || right
thats || right
I || know || it || might just have been || a fluke
yeah
it || probably || was
but || just || a || that || she || was || in || a weird position
I || just || wondered
yeah yeah
well || did || that mean || that || they || planned || you
you || didnt || hafta
yes || it || was planned no
well || they || were waiting || until || I || went || into || labor
but || I || didnt go || into || labor || for
um || they || were leaving || me || for || a week || to see || if || I || would go || into
but || I || didnt go || into || labor || even then
so || they || just
I || was || so petrified
they || felt || sorry || for || me
so || they || said || theyd || leave || me || until || I || went || into || labor
did || you || have || a anaesthetic || a + ..
yes || yes
I || think || Id || want || that too
now || I dont || think || I || would do || that || the next time
wouldnt || you
it || was || horrible || going || under
was || it
you || see || Id || had || an operation || a couple || of || years || ago
and || they || give || you || a premed and
yes
you || were || sort || of || happy || as || Larry
you dont care || what || happens || you
and || it || really || relaxes || you
and || then || they || just || give || you || a wee injection || in || your hand
and || youre || away to sleep
but || the section || was || different
you || were going || to || the theater || without || any premed
oh no
and || you || were || actually || in || the theater || without || any premed
it || was || terrible
I hadta || close || my eyes || the whole time
and || even || when || they || were talking || to || me || I || was || still
they || were saying || to || me + || /
are || you || okay
and || I || shaked || my head
I couldnt || open || my eyes || see || everyone || with || their
ah
and || then || when || they || do put
now || I || read || beforehand || about || having || a section
and || it || says || they || hafta pump oxygen || into || your stomach || to get || it || to
really
it || sounds || awful
you || imagine || the size || of || a balloon || away || up || to || here
I dont || believe || it
what || actually || happens || once || you || breathe || suddenly || in || it || might
because || you dont || notice || it
ah
you dont || even || notice || youre || breathing || in || the oxygen
but || then || they || changed || the
and || then || youre breathing || in || whatevers || putting || you || to sleep
ah ah
and || you || feel || your whole body || going || numb
ah
and || the last thing || I || felt going || numb || was || my mouth
oh no
and || then || you || just || seen || the blackness
oh that || was || horrible
oh no
thats || why || I || wouldnt go || under || that anaesthetic || again
horrid
it || was || horrible
it || really || was
and || what || about Peter || did || he + ..
he || he || waited || in || a room || there
oh || yes
next door || because || they || dont let || you || in || if || theyre || doing || a general
so || if || I || had || of || had || the epidural block
yes
he || could of come || in
yes
so || I || says || if || I || did || hafta || have || a Caesarean || the next time || I || would go
yeah yes
because || um || I || mean || youre not giddy or anything || when || you || come
yes || yes
you || know
yeah
apparently || you || can feel || a bit || of || wetness || when || the water breaks
my cousin || said || it || felt || like || someone || was washing || their hands || in || her
thats || disgusting
but || she || was
and || they || usually || have || that || was || breach
and || up || to || the last minute || they didnt || know
right
and || then || they || said || it || was || maybe alright
and || they || tried turning
oh || they
they || tried turning
apparently || they dont || do || that || now
but || they || says || because || I || was || Rhesus || negative || that || they || dont do || that
oh gosh
and || the baby || was || positive || so that || the blood || crosses or || something
does || it || mean || that || youd hafta || have || a transfusion or anything
no its um ah || an injection || of || um Anti D || whatever that || is
that || was to protect || subsequent babies
oh
oh || right || gosh || are || you || going to be || a doctor
do || you || like || that
does || she || come || along || with || you || too || when || you || go
she || did || the last time
but || its too long || to wait
but || she || will come || the next time || when || were actually seeing || the scan
it || will be || such a long wait || for || her || until || the baby || comes
its its difficult || to know || it
youre || very || tidy
you || put || everything || away
thats || what || I || like to see
I || wish || my boys || would do || that
youre || very quiet || today Flossy
although || my cousin || she || had || two babies || subsequently || with || normal
did || she Rose
even || though || she || had || a section
you || see || I || thought || it || was || a good idea || have || a section || this time
because || I || was || petrified || of || going || through || the birth thing
so || I || thought || + " /
och Ive || had || an operation || before
and || it || was || no problem
and || I || get || over || operations || really quickly
and || I || thought || this || would have been || quite a good idea
because || even the doctor || in || hospital || says || to || me + || /
with || a bit || of || luck || it || might turn
but || I || says || + " /
no Im || hoping || it || doesnt
I wanna || have || a section
ah
I || think || he || thought || I || was || crazy
but || they || I || knew || why afterwards
like || you || were || really || just afterwards || really
it || was || awful
especially || when || everyone || else || was getting || out || of || bed
and || I hadta || lie || in || bed || for
well || I || mean || I || could get || out || to go || down || for || meals
but || I || couldnt || really || jump || out || feed and change || Rachel || for || a
yes || yes
I hadta || get || the nurses || to come and do || that
and || with || your first baby || its a bit || of || a shock || after || about the
ah
your first attempt || at || trying to change || a nappie || after || about three
oh dear yes yes
well || was || she || quite easy || earlier || on
what
was || Rachel quite || easy earlier || on
naw she || was || a terrible baby || she || was
I || called || her || a live wire
I didnt wanna || say || she || was || a terrible baby
a live wire || seemed || appropriate enough
wheres || the scissors || again
she || did || nothing but cry || for || the first couple || of || months
oh gosh yes
no matter || what || I || did || though
I || really || dont || think || there || was || anything || the matter || with || her
I || think || she || would have been || like || that || no matter || what
yeah yes
because || my mum || tried to tell || me || that || she || wasnt getting || enough food
because || I || was || breast || feeding || her
oh || yes
not || getting || enough food
and || my aunt || tried to tell || me || she || had || colic
I || knew || instinctively || that || she didnt
because || she || always || burped || herself || even
yeah
even || when || I || lifted || her || up || you || know
yeah yeah
do || you || want || that
theres || the girl
yes Rob || cried || cried || for || about three months || I || tried
it || really || wears || you || down || doesnt || it
yeah
who || lives || next door || she || just || had || a heart attack
I || mean || it || was || always || great
because || she || was always sitting || there || able || to do || anything
so || I || could just give || it
so || she || could nurse || him
yeah yeah
well || that's
and || she || would say || + " /
I || think || hes
and || I || would feel
and || then || you || feel || guilty || you || know
too
she || did just wanna be || nursed || the whole time
yeah
really
and || when || I || put || her || down || at all || it || was || terrible
and || then || I || says || + " /
me Im || going to get || one || of || those slings || to use || around
great
at least || maybe || you || could get || the dishes || done || make || the beds
but maybe || this one || will not need || that
yes
I didnt || actually || have || one || with || Rachel
by || the time || I || sort || of || thought || about || it || you || know
so || I || says || I || would get || one || of || those
and || another thing || that || I || could have did || with || was || something || that
ach yes
because || I || spent || ages || rocking || her || down
ah
mum mum mum
wait || to || see || where || they || go || Rachel
I || think || that pair || goes || in || there
I || wonder || why || theres || two scissors || there
what || do || you || think || thats || for
and whats || that || for
I || dont know
does || your mum || ever || take || your temperature
mummie || puts || a wee thing || on || your head || to take || your temperature
oh || of || course yes thats || right
Ive || never || had || those
they || seem to be || okay
thats || much || simpler || isnt || it
uhhuh
I || just || useta do || it || under || their arms
and || you || know || you || can usually just feel || just || from || them cant || you
thats || right
sometimes || I || know || you || really || just use || it || to confirm || it || dont || you
or || just || to see || how || it || is
0
I || think || we || need || your hair || cut || again || Rachel

and || how || about || the driving
well || I || was || actually || sposta || do || my test || tomorrow
I || got || a letter || last week
and || I || thought || it || was || a good idea || at || first
because || it || was || before || the first || of || July || you || know || when || the theory
oh thats || coming || in so soon
uhhuh she || then || I || thought || about || it
and || I || thought || + " /
oh no
I || was || so ill || last week
Thursday and Friday || was || really || bad
I || just || couldnt || face || it
so || I || canceled || it
and || hopefully || my feell || get returned || to || me
so || I || thought || it || would be || better canceling || it || than || sort || of || throwing
so || I || knew || I || was

I dont || feel || too bad
oh look || at || that lovely
I || think || the nauseas
because || Im not || heaving || as much || now || during || the day
all the smells || during || the day || when || the decorator || was || here || you || know
the Polyfilla and all || that || was || the one || that || really || got || me
but || there || was || so many different ones || all blending || in || that || I || did

well || I || havent actually been too fatigued || during || the day || with
so || it || hasnt been || too bad
weve || been doing || a lot || of || sort || of || eating || out || you || know || our lunch
I || find || that || I || can sort || of || eat || better || outside
the last time || as well || I || was || like || that
I || think || it || was || the difference || that || I || dont || hafta || cook || it || as well
its even thinking || about || food || having || a plan and things
I || mean || theres || a lot || of || things
but || its || back || to || food || for || me || again
though || I || made || a roast dinner || for || us || on || Sunday
and || I || really || enjoyed || it
so || that || definitely || was || the best day || I || felt || so far
and || I || have managed to make || a dinner || last night || as well
would Peter cook
no you || see || he || really || cant cook
he doesnt || really || have || much || of || an idea
its not something || that || hes || really || interested || in || doing
hes || been getting || a lot || of || Chinese takeaways
laughs
he sort || of || has said || like || + " /
I || will make || myself || something || to eat || later || on
chicken Korma || something
but || he || hasnt actually bothered

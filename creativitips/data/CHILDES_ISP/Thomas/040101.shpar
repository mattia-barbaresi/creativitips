passengers || to || the seaside
Bertie bus || having || a little race || with || him
do || you || remember
oh yeah
and || then || I || think
oh no
I || think || thats || two separate stories
because || I || think || Thomas and Bertie || had || a race
in || one story

and || another story
yeah
is || where
Thomas || is going || somewhere
and || he || breaks || down
and || Bernie the bus hasta || meet || him
and || pick || up || all his passengers
and || carry carry || on
taking || them || to || where ever || they || were going
do || you || remember || this little bus Thomas
yeah
we || searched || all over
to get || you || a bus
because || you || were obsessed || with || red buses
and || we couldnt || find || one
or || one || that || was || suitable || for || a little boy || as || young || as || you
were || at || the time
and || then || one day || I || went || into || Mothercare
and || I || saw || that || I || bought || it
and || you || played || for || hours || with || it
wheres || the bus
wheres || the bus
thats || all || you
did || you || go || “ wheres || the bus ”
even || when || you || knew || where || it || was
you useta || go || round || saying
wheres || the bus
and || one day Aunty Val and Jo || came to visit
and || they || were || sitting || on || the settee
I dont || think || Aunty Val || had || children || at || the time
Jo || possibly || had
yeah Jo || must have had || Bethy || because || thats
um || luckily || Jo || was wearing || trousers
because || you || said || “ wheres || the bus ” || opened || her legs
to look to see || if || she || had || it
laughs
and || you || useta do || things || like || this
youd || put || it || there || youd || say
wheres || the bus
laughs
is || it || like || this
wheres || the bus
yes oh || you
and || then || youd do || this and go
Im magic
you || would always know || where || it || was
you useta || have || this cheeky little nod
and || then || when || you || were || in || the car
yeah
I || remember going || somewhere || with || Grandad || once
whenever || you || saw || a bus || you useta || go

Thomas || do || you || remember || the other day
I cant || think || where || we || were
we || were || on || a train
Im sure || we || were || on || a train || perhaps || we || were || on || a bus
and || we || saw || a bit || of || railway track
with || traffic lights || on
but || were || we || on || a train
that || was || really || weird
a level || crossing
no
it || wasnt
Oh I || know || weve || seen || a level || cross crossing
when || we || went to see || Nana Beal
but || we || definitely || saw || some cars || having to wait
while || the barriers || went || down || at || a level crossing
but || Im sure || we || were || on || a train
we || were
and || we || looked || down
and || do || you || remember || there || was || a sort || of || track
almost || like || a road
a dirt track || that || didnt || seem to lead || anywhere
and || there || were || traffic lights stati proper train lights
do || you || remember
yeah
wasnt || that || funny
maybe || that || should be || where || all the trains || that
too || um rusty || they || bash || them || there
do || you || think || so
but || why || would || they || want || traffic lights || there
because || then || they || say || “ danger danger ”
think || it || was || just a warning
or || do || you || think || the traffic lights
the train lights || were || rusty
so || if || theyre || putting || all the broken train || there
they || must have thought
oh the poor old lights arent || working || anymore
well || put || them || down || there
yeah
hm
when || um
just || pretend || um
Thomas || is going to do || a loud hoot || when || hes || here
right

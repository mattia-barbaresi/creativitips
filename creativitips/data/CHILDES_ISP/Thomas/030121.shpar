did || you || say || the green light || was || on
Thomas
pardon
that || green light
oh good
and || that || green light
good
well || thats || the microphone
so || we || need || those lights || on || dont || we
what || for
because if || the lights arent || on || it || means || the batterys || have gone
so || we hafta || keep looking || dont || we
to check || that || the green light || is || on
its || on || ap orange light
and || red light
well || yes
when || we || look || at || the actual piece || of || equipment || the orange light
comes || on
yes
it || comes || on
it || means || that || its || plugged || into || the electricity
and || when || the green lights || come || on || it || means || that || the batterys || are
is || on || it || means
so weve || got to look || at || the red light || on || the machine
mhm
the green light || on || these two microphones
yeah
and || then || on || the monitors weve || got to check || theres || a green || a
so || thats || five lights weve || got to look || for
and || the other day || what || happened
no tricity
no electricity
I || forgotten || what day || that || was
was || it || Monday
we || we || plugged || everything || in || checked || it || was working
they || were working
then || we || did || a recording didnt || we
yeah
and || then || when || it || finished
yeah
you || wanted || a drink || of || milk
yes
and || sweetie
well || probably || sweeties || as well
and || when || we || went to warm || the milk nothing || in || the kitchen || worked
so || we || turned || the television || on
that didnt work
there || was || no electricity || was || there
no
no tricty
and || then || when || we || listened || to || our recording
mhm
it hadnt || recorded || anything || had || it
no
because || the electricity || must have gone || off || just || after || I || checked
and || what || I || normally || do || I || just || check
once weve || checked || initially || that || those || are working || we || just || check
to look || for || green lights
mhm
no green lights
yes
we || never || went || back || to see || if || there || were || green and orange lights

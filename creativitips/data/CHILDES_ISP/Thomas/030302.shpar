what || was || it || we || were looking || at
just || them
that
I didnt || know || what time || it || was || so || I hadta || go || check
oh weve || done || the fire engine
ah || we || were || on || the digger werent || we
diggers || can dig || a berth || in || sand
scoop || up || the sand || dump || it || over || here
roaro
thats || like || this digger isnt || it
oh || Thomas
youve || got || your umbrella || inside || the digger

this umbrella || is going to be broken || before || you || get || chance || to use || it
look || at || this digger
you || see || its exactly the same
and || you || were || digging sand werent || you
just || the same
it || has got || a red bucket || a yellow bit || that || lifts || up

a bulldozer
yeah
whats || the difference || between || the bulldozer || the digger
hm
there isnt || an awful lot || looking || at || the picture
but || Im sure there || must be
maybe somewhere
hm
just || checking || us || for || jacket
well diggers || must dig || the ground
bulldozers || I || think || must move || really || heavy loads || dont || they
ah
funnily enough || thats || what || it || says
lets read || it
a bulldozer || can push || very heavy loads || with || its strong blade
fill || up || the blade || drop || the bricks
crasho bango wallopo
a bulldozer
right
so || a a bulldozer || a digger || are || a bit || different
bulldozers || are || more || for || moving || things || arent || they
hm
for || picking || up || things || moving || them || somewhere else
whereas || a digger || is || for || digging
right
were || on || the last page || now

nobody || seems to want || him
nobody || seems to realize || hes || all alone || has || no home || to go || to

so || thats || a nice story isnt || it
Im sure thats || going to be
ap || read || this book
this one || is called || Christmas || in || Exeter Street
and || I || do think || this one || is || a little bit || too old || for || you || at || the
I || know || about || this book
it || says || from || top || to || bottom the house || in || Exeter Street || is || full
I || get || something
ap || you || stay || there
I || get || something || up || there
no
the gates || shut || now

I || wonder || if || he || has got || any stones || on || the back || of || his van

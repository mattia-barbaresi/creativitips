what || a big
big cloth
a big cloth
thats || right
yes
you || saw || the fireman
he || rushed || in || he || grabbed || the big cloth
I || would imagine || its a fire blanket
but || if || you || havent got || a fire blanket || you || can use || something || like || an
and || he || threw || it || on || top || of || the the fire || uh || the flames didnt
on || the pan
you || never || pour || water || onto || the chip || pan || because || when || the water hits
and || really badly || burn || them
you || either || put || a fire blanket || on like || the firemen || do || you || know
like || the big trays || she || bakes || the biscuits || on
something || like || that || to put || on || top
or || else || you || get || something || like || a towel || a tea towel
and || ring || it || out
you || can put || water || on || the tea towel
ring || it || out
and || put || it || on || to smother || the flames

it || must have been blowing || along || the streets || a big gust || of
and || it || has got stuck || right || on || top || of || the tree
what || for
well just || has || darling
thats || what || happens || when || when || things || blow || up

and || so sometimes || when || we || say || shh
Thomas || be || quiet

its like music class

I || see
well Im sure || on || the day youll || want || more friends
funnily enough || Ive || got || the Bob || the Builder book || in || front || of || me
so || Im || going to have || a quick look || through || it || see || if || I || can find
because || I || think || it || looked || very much || like || the wheel || was going || to
oh || is || it || the crane
is || it Lofty || the Crane || the blue machine
yeah
mhm
yes
it || is || about || Lofty
Lofty || is || a tall mobile crane
he || worries || about all sorts || of || things
and || he || talks || to || himself || when || he || feels || nervous
he || feels || better || when || Bob || the others || tell || him || hes doing || well
Lofty || is || scared || of || just about || everything
even heights
which || is || odd || for || a crane
he doesnt || like || stretching || up || too high || in || case || he || feels || giddy
Loftys favorite || saying || is || “ uh yeah || I || think || so || ”
is || that || what || he || says
yes
are || you || very busy || watching || that and not || wanting to talk || to || me
mhm
theres || another bus || going || past
a mini bus || this time
actually || looking || at || this picture || in || Bob || the Builder Thomas
theres || a blue pussy cat
a blue crane
what || else || is || blue || in || that picture
something thats || very close || to || your heart
whats || that
a dustbin
a blue dustbin
a radiator
a radiator
thats || a radio
but || it || is || a blue radio
and || even || the post box || is || blue
thats strange isnt || it
I cant || see || a post
yes
look || at || this
a postbox isnt || red
its blue
and || youve || been asking || for || a blue birthday cake
and || look
theres || a blue birthday cake
I || want || ap || eat || it
you wanna || eat || it
yeah
I dont || think || we || can eat || that || birthday cake
oh look
theres Lofty || again
and || this || is || rather funny || because || on || the television || its || showing
and || theres || a page || on || this book || it || says || about hay || on || father
so || that || must be || the farm || that || theyre visitting || on || the
Lofty and Wendy || are || dancing || on || the television arent || they
yes
so || do || you || think || Bob || was dancing || before
yes
Mummy || thats || a blue post box
that story || on || the television || is || it || called || Buffalo Bob
yeah
because || the last story || in || this book || is || Buffalo Bob
and || I || just || thought || it
oh look
look || at || this
now || isnt || this strange
look || Lofty
Bob and Wendy || are putting || hats || on
look
and || in || the book
are || they || going || line dancing
yeah
isnt || that || funny
we cant || hear || the sound || on || the television || we || can actually read
ap look || at || the blue post box
you needta look || at || the blue post box
okay
there || we || are
well || it || it || says || what || you || find
all sorts || on || that picture
ap no letters
no letters
no
I dont || think || anybodys || posting || letters || in || the letter box
no key
no keyhole
no keyhole || on || the post box
no
when || we || look || at || the red post box || down || the road || theres || always
perhaps || its not || a letter box Thomas
but || I || cant || think || what else || it || will be
it || is || a letter box
perhaps || its not || the one || that || the postman || goes || to
perhaps || its Bob and Wendys letterbox
I || think || its Pilchards
you || think || its Pilchards
well || it || is || blue isnt || it
yes
its Loftys
its Loftys
do || you || think || all the the um machines
I couldnt || think || of || the name
do || you || think || they || all || get || letters
yeah
perhaps || the postman || delivers || them || to || all the post box
Im || just || looking || through || this book || to see || if || I || can find || a picture
just || to see || if || the post box || is || outside || of || his house || or || down || the
I cant || see || anything || so far
well || hafta || look || on || the television
thats Daddy

do || you || mean || grit || as || in
things || that || you || grit || the road || with
when || its slippy and icy || outside
yep
right
that sort || of || grit
or || I || just || wondered || if || youre || talking || about || cement || then
you || meant || something || different
waho Im || slipping
Im || slipping || on || the
waho
help
was
if || its grit Thomas
and || its || put || down || to stop || people || slipping
surely || the man shouldnt || slip || when || he || stands || on || it
thats || what || hes standing || on
the point
hes || standing || on || the point
or || the bit || that || goes || down
looks || like || this
right
Thomas || did || the notes || come || out || of || this till
with || the toy money
no
did || they || come || out || of || the other || till
yes
have || you || had || out || today
no
now || where || would || you || like || me || to put || them || back
oh || just || leave || settee
no
we cant || leave || them || on || the settee
because || its || going to get lost
if || the coins || go || down || the back youll || never || see || them || again
what || will happen
because || I cant || get || them || back
if || they || go || into || the frame || of || the sofa
thats || it
its || gone || forever
thats || where || I || think || half || of || your toys || go
the small toys
things || like || bits || of || Lego
I dont || put || things || on || the settee || for || that reason
or || the chairs
whats || in || the flame
well || its springs and things
youve || got || the frame || of || the chair
and || then || youve got || the cushions
but || theres || a bit || right down || there
that || we || just || cant || get || to
and || by || the time || someone
really
oh yes || of || course || you
yes || yes
I || told || you || before || about not leaving Lego and things || on
because || Ive || forgotten || what || it || is
many months || ago || we || lost || something || down || there
a vital
yes
one || of || your toys
has gone || down || there
and || it || spoilt || the toy
because || we cant play || with || it || now
I
well || we wont || see || it || again
and || probably || if || ever the sofa || lasts || long enough
to recover || it
by || the time || we || get || round || to || having || it || recovered
youll || be grown || up
and wont || be || interested || in || toys || any more
Im || just || gathering || these pennies and things || together
right
Ive || forgotten || what || we || were talking || about now
grit
grit
thats || right
grit
ah
are || you || alright
I || told || you youd || be tipped || up || now
0
oh
whats || that || your thumb
yes
round || the
and guess || what
its || going to put || grit || on || the man
look
this || actually || says || Thomas
lets play || lets go || shop
lets || play || with || money
no
money tray || with || coin compartments
include || pretend coins || bank notes
there || must have been || some bank || notes || in || there || as well
isnt || there
I wanna play grit
no
we || are playing || grit
its || just || Im || tidying || it || up
before || we || lose || bits || down || the sofa
but || when || I || stopped to ask || you || before
about || the bank notes
you || were
you || didnt seem to think || that || the notes || came || with || it
but || I || think || they || must do
they || didnt
they || come || with || the other || till
did || they
well theyre || all || kept || in || the same box
do || they || they || fit || in
what || do || you || wanna do || with || these train sockets
leave || them || there
no
Im not || leaving || anything || around
what || do || you || want || me || to do || with || it
just || put || them || on || the workbench
the work bench
thats
hes || very busy || that || chappie isnt || he
is || it icy
is || it || slippy
yep
and || thats
wheels || are skipping
they
oh || I || see
well || the trouble || is || you || see || the
poor man || dropping || the grit
where || he || drives
its not um gritty || is || it
because || hes not || dropped || the grit || yet
is || that || where || hes || getting || all unstuck
having || problems
hes || done || hes hes || put || grit
all || over || the road
and || now now || he || can run || on || it
oh thats || better || isnt || it
yes
thats || it
once || the grits || gone || down || everybody can grip
cant || they
oh look
its stopped
stopped
right
why
and || then || a smaller one || comes
I || would imagine || hes || run || out || of || grit || has || he
no
theres 0a || smaller || one
oh look || at || that
that || is || a baby one
I || dont think || that || would carry || much grit Thomas || do || you
this this truck || would
oh || yes
but || thats || a big one isnt || it
putting || lots || of || grit || in
and || it || never || skids
thats || its brakes
it || could do || with || caterpillar wheels

grasses || is || one pound

a Sid || as || in || Hollys Dad
is || al sl il dl
acid || is || al cl il dl
theres || a Sid
0
a Sid acid
I || must not like || him || any || more || if || hes || a acid
no
uhoh
so
this || is || why || you || shouldnt || eat sweets || in || between || meals
because || in || between meals
theres || enough || saliva || in || your mouth
mhm
to take || away || the acid || from || the meal
as || long || as || you dont || put || other rubbish || in || your mouth
before || the next mealtime
and || if || you || do
then || the saliva hasnt || got || the chance || to take || the acid || away
and || youre || putting || more sugary sticky things || on || your teeth
and || it || just || rots || your teeth Tom
somebody || dropped || their teeth
no
rotten not || dropped || them
rot || them
what || will happen || then
well || the acid attacks || the enamel
then || you || get || a little hole || in || your tooth
and || then || oofo || it || hurts
Im glad || I dont || have || it
well || Im not || saying || youll || never || have || it
when || you || do || something || like || drink juice || just || before || going || to || bed
I || think || the best thing || we || can do || for || you
is || to || ask || you || to brush || your teeth || again
dont || you
I wanna brush || me || own
oh || you || can do
yeah || can || I
yeah
really
yep
without || you
well || no
I || needta actually be || there Thomas
children || under || under || a certain age
should || really || have || Mummys || Daddys || there because
you || only || need || a small amount || of || toothpaste
I || will put || a small amount
Ill || put || this much
oh you || have brushed || them || before || on || your own || I || know
havent || you
and || I || did || well
did || very well
Mum Ill || only || put || this much
toothpaste
but || remember || that || toothbrush || is going || in || your mouth
so || you dont mess || about || with || it
you dont || start brushing || anything || else
or || touching || anything || else
how || are || these nails || feeling
0
very hard
ow

0
what || do || you || mean || “ || very || hard || ”
Im || nearly || finished
oh theyre || looking || beautiful and clean
they || are || honestly
I dont || like || it
I || know || you || dont sweetheart
its a funny little noise || this isnt || it
snip snip || with || the red scissors
when || you || were || a baby || you || had || some || with
blue || handles || scissors
these red ones || are || the ones
that || we || keep || in || the bathroom || we || all || use || them
wheres || the blue ones
the blue ones || I || think || are || in || the drawer
will || they rake
well || no
but || the blue ones || are || very rounded || very
gentle || for || little babies
because of || course || you || know || when || when || youre || only || a baby
are || they || gentle
well
Im sure theyd || still || work
these work || better || I || would imagine
now || youre || a bit || older
wish || I || could || things || on || me
pardon
wish || I || could cut || things || on || me || own
well || you || can cut || things || on || your own
paper and things
although || I || still || needta be || around
I wouldnt || let || you || loose cutting || your own nails Tom
why
well || because || its quite a tricky job
and
mhm
if || you || cut || them || badly
or || you || cut || the skin || it || would hurt || an awful lot
then || what || would happen
well then || youd || have || a poorly toe
then || have || stitches
well || no
I dont || think || youd need stitches
unless || you || actually || cut || your toe || off
I || think || youd || need || a jolly big pair || of || scissors
to do || that || dont || you
laughs
me || too
or || garden shears
bigger than baby scissors
oh || certainly || bigger || than || baby sni scissors yes
snissorsf we || nearly || said || then || didnt || we
snippers
scissors
bigger than kitchen scissors
laughs
yes thats || why || I || was saying || a pair || of || garden shears || would be
good || for || cutting || your foot || off
but || I dont || think || theyd || cut || your foot || off
there || you || are
those beautiful feet
shall || we || put || some nice powder || on || them

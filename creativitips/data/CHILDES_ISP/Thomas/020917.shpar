Im || going to put || some salt || in || the dishwasher
I dont || think || youve || seen || this happen || before
no
are || you || close enough
hm yes
lets move || those things || first
and || move || you || a little bit || nearer
there
hm
now
right
now || thats || inside || the dishwasher
yeah
well || take || that || off
yeah
and || then
lots || of || water
lots || of || water
and || a special funnel
have || you || seen || that
its || called || a funnel
you || put || it || in || there
um
mhm
and || it || just || helps || pour things || into || a different place || more easily
mhm
Ill || leave || that || there || a second
put || sausages || in || it
put || sausages || in || it
no
Id || rather || you didnt
now || this || is called || dishwasher salt
yes
its a special salt
its not || like || the salt || that || we || have || in || salt and pepper Thomas
and || we || pour || it || from || this bag || into || there
like || that
it || went || rather quickly || didnt || it
it || has gone
please put || it || down
can || you || see || it || pouring || down || the hole
yeah
put || it || down || here
well || Ive || I || dont think || it || should have gone || down || there
thered || only a couple || of || granules || thatve just spilt || havent
and || gone || down || the other side
right
lets lift || the funnel || up
look
it || has || all gone hasnt || it
now || what Ive || got to do
I || should have left || the machine || plugged || in || because || the reason || I || know
can || you || see
and || that || says || salt
and || that || means || salt || in || it
and || we || keep putting || salt || in || until || the red light || comes || out
sometimes || its full enough || it || forgets to switch
so || we || put || the funnel || back || in
like || that
it || has gone || off
has || it || gone || off || now
yeah
right
well || theres || obviously || enough salt || in || there
this || happens || sometimes
when || I || put || the lid || on || the light || goes || off
right
so now || we needta || screw || that cup || on || again
screw
screw || the cup || on
mhm
there || we || are
yes

its spinning around
thats || called || the arm || on || the dishwasher
yes
its spinning around
and || then || we || put || this || back || in
this || is || the basket
mhm
and || when || we wanna wash something || we || put || powder || in || that one and then
let || me || show || you || this
just || hafta || leave || you || a second
and || you || must be || ever so || careful || never || to touch || any || of || these things
no
because || theyll || burn || your skin
burn || your skin
theyll || burn
and || that wouldnt || be || very nice
um
now || weve || got || lots || of || things || in || this cupboard havent || we
mhm
where || we || keep || all the cleaning material
I || like || it || now
what || do || you || like
I || like || it || hot
like || it || hot
yeah
anyway
can || you || just || stand || up || a bit
you || never || ever || touch || any || of || these things
because if || they || touch || your skin oh itll || be || sore
itll || hurt
right then
thats || called || rinse aid

yeah
there || was || a little gas van || at || one || of || the houses || yesterday || its
and || theres a big gas van || there || as well || now
where
just || behind || Stephens car
look
Stephens || getting || into || his car
and || theyre || setting || off
I || cant || see
I cant || see || Mummy
cant || you
is || it
why || cant || you || see
because of || the plant
no
oh
I || know || what || it || is
hm
Daddy || has gone || on || his bike || to work || left || the car || at || home
and || you cant || see || past || the car || can || you
no
little bit || taller || than || you || so || I || can see
I || was just wondering || why || you couldnt || see
because || normally || you || can see || everything || that || goes || on
but || Ive || realized || what || it || is
bother
missed || it
never || mind
youve || seen || Stephen || driving || off || many times
and || Im sure youll || see || him || do || it || again
we || went || to || their house || over || the summer didnt || we
we || did
on || the trampoline
yes
might go || today
today
I || know
it || looks || like || Liam || has gone || to || school doesnt || it
and || youre || at || Missus Plattfords || this afternoon || at || nursery
yeah
and || Isabelle || say || “ || where || has || Thomas gone ”
mhm
where
well || Isabelles || at || school || as || well isnt || she
liz Isabelle || has gone || to || a little school || it || is || a
you || know || a little straw hat
no
she useta || wear || a little straw hat || when || she || was || very very young
and || now || she || wears || a straw boater || to go to school || in
she || started || on || Tuesday
oh thats || today
no no thats || Thursday || today
and || Ben || started || at || St Johns || which || is || the school youre || going || to
I dont || want || this piece || of || bread
alright
thats fine
youve || done || very well
Ben || started || St Johns school || in || Heaton Mersey || which || is || the one
because || I || tried || several times || to ring || Lynne || to see || how || he || had
but || there || was || nobody || answering || the phone
then || when || we || went || out || for || a walk || last night || before || seven oclock
so || I || would imagine || he || has had || a very tiring day and hadta || go || to
I || think || 0so
and || what || about || Charlotte
what || do || you || think || Charlotte || has been doing
I || think || a painting
you || think || Charlotte || has been painting
I || bet || shell || miss || him || dont || you
because || she || has always had || a big brother || at || home
hes || not || there anymore
so || Thomas || this time || next year || you || will have started || the same
and || Ben || will will have been || there || a year and hell || be || able || to
because || Ben || is || eight months || older || than || you || isnt || he
so || whatever Ben || has done || you || do || shortly afterwards

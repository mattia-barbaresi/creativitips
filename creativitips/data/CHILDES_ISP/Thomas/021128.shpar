we || went || to || Charlottes party
we || then || went || to || the Spa shop
we || bought || some daffodils || for || Grandma
I cant || think || what || else || we || bought
oh || it || was || milk
I || think || we || wanted || milk
and || then || we || dashed || home
yeah
Daddy || drove || us || into || Didsbury || we || went to see || the dentist
and || then || that night || we || went || over || to see || Granddad didnt || we
Grandma || Granddad
that || was || a very very busy day
yeah
is || that apple nice
mhm
good
thatll || keep || your teeth || nice || as well
if || you crunch || on || an apple wont || it
the dentist || likes || it || when || you || tell || him || you || eat || a lot || of || apples
and || you || you || eat || a lot || of || fruit dont || you
mhm
oh || that || made || a noise
listen || at || this || taking || the label || off || the box
oh
laughs
Jack || in || the Box
a Jack || in || the Box
yes
it || could be couldnt || it
definitely || very loud || when || we || did || that
I || think || I || had || better || finish || my coffee || before || it || gets || cold
must have been made || nearly || an hour || now
got || a big bruise || on || my foot Thomas
yeah
have || you || been jumping || on || me
yeah
have || you
yeah
hm
I || thought || as || much
poor Mummy
I || play || my shop
one that door
on || the floor
its post lorry door
the post lorry door
mhm
that one
oh || yes
oh the back || of || the door || fell || off || didnt || it
pulled || it
pardon
my || pull || it || on || my teeth
you || pulled || it || with || your teeth || did || you
and || then || it || fell || off || onto || the floor
never || mind
you || thought || you || had broken || it || didnt || you
and || you || got quite upset
and || Mummy || said || “ dont || worry || Ill || fix || it || ”
and || I || did || didnt || it
look
Ive || just || noticed || Daddys shirts || on || the floor
must have fallen || down || from || the drying rack
better || hang || it || up || again otherwise || it || wont get || dry || will || it
now || I || think || the thing || is || though || those lorrys Thomas it's
but || if || you || start dropping || it || bits || are going to fall || off || are
its a little bit || like || that blue mini car || that || Granddad || bought || you
mhm
you || dropped || that || the doors || fell || off || didnt || they
but || with || the post lorry || I || think || the doors || are meant to come || off
but || theyre || very || easy || to put || them || back

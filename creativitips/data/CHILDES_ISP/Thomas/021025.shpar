I 0can || remember
it || was || a big orange lorry wasnt || it
and || it || had || a sign || on || it || that || said || stop and go
and || the men || were drilling || some holes || in || the ground and erecting
because || I || think || some people || have been driving || through || with || cars
and || thats || a bit naughty
so || they || were putting || up || some bollards || to stop || people || doing || that
just open || the door || because || I || think || Purdie || wants to go || out

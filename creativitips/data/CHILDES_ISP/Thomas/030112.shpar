Christophers tractor

I || want || ap not share
you || want || what || love
not || share
you dont wanna share

no
its your tractor || now || Christopher || was || good enough || to share
yeah
because || you || got || a little bicycle || that || you || ride || on || when || we || go || out
but || really || over || winter weve || had || it || inside || the house and youve || had
and fire engine
youve || done || all sorts || with || your bicycle havent || you
so weve || decided || really || its better || to keep || that inside and just || on
because if || you || take || it || out || in || the garden || on || the grass || when || its wet
and || its not nice inside
and || Christophers Mummy || was getting || rid || of || Christophers tractor
and || he || was || too big || for || it
and || when || she || saw || you || knew || you || liked || tractors || she || said || would
Christopher || say || yeah
Christopher || was || happy || for || you || to have || it || wasnt || he
yeah
not || say || anything
well || he || was just pleased || it || was going || to || a good home
and || he || knew || he || was || too big || for || it
I || think || he || was just pleased || that somebody || else || was going || to
so || this || is || the thing Thomas
as || youre || growing || up || getting || too big || for || some || of || your toys
yeah
we dont || really || know || many little boys || that || are || younger || than || you
no
most || of || your friends || are || girls || arent || they

Come || Outside
oh
no making newspapers
oh || yes
thats || the one || that || you || saw || the other day wasnt || it
mhm
what || were || they || doing
a big machine || come || on || na nee naso
a big machine || came
nee nao || on
its Pippin || frightened
oh || was || there
was || it || like || a forklift truck
lifting || all the papers
yeah
and || it || frightened || Pippin || did || it
Pippin || run || away
a man || come put || a new newspaper || in || his teeth
oh I || know || what || youre talking || about
yes that || was || funny
on || the program || it || showed || a man || buying || a newspaper
then || at || the end || of || the program Pippin || was carrying || Auntie Mabels
oh || I || always || say || his
its her teeth isnt || it
but || do || you || remember || that dog || we || saw || in || Didsbury || a few weeks || ago
yeah
and || the boy || runned
and || the man
it || was || a big red
oh || yes
that || was || the boy || that || fell || over || wasnt || it

we || were walking || one day
I cant || remember || whether || it || was || a Saturday || a Friday but one
ap || come || home
we || were coming || home || we || saw || a big red setter dog didnt || we
we || were walking || back || from || Didsbury || there || was || a man || behind

Mum
could || you || be || the man || behind || the counter
yeah
you || could either be || a bank clerk || you || would || you || like to be || the
does || he || put || out || the money
well || I || dont || quite || know || what || a bank manager || does || I || would imagine
I || wanna be || the cashier
the cashier
right
okay
but || the bank manager || is || probably || the man || who || says || how much || can go
I || mean || the managers || an important person isnt || he
he || runs || the bank
Mum || I || be || the shopkeeper || too
hello
hello
well || you || can go || into || shops || where || you || can get || money
mm
hello
hello
wha
um || well || Id || like || a bottle || of || Coca Cola || please
I || am || a shop
oh I || thought || you || were || the shopkeeper || as well
I || meant to say || the bank keeper
the bank keeper || the bank manager
mm
right
okay
hello
hm
hello Mr bank manager
hm
hello || I || have || some money || please
mm
now || how || have || I || got || in || my bank account
four
four hundred pounds
yeah
or || just || four pounds
four pounds
four pounds || oh dear

oh
right
well || I || think || if || Ive || only || got || four pounds || in || Id || better actually
until || I || get
beepo
oh Ive just been paid || have || I
yeah
and || all this money || has come || in
but || do || you || know || what || happens || Thomas
no
when || people || go to work
mm
when || they || work || hard
yeah
they || get paid
mm
and || the money || that || they || earn || goes || into || the bank
and || then its || there || in || the bank || for || me || to take || out
which || is || why || Mummy || works || hard || to earn || pennies
and || why || when || we || go || to || the cash machine || theres || usually || money || there
and || you || can only take || out || the amount youve || got || if || youve || no money
and || thats || why || many times || when || were || shopping || you || see || things
you || know || you cant || have || you || cant || buy || absolutely || everything || you
and || if || we || run || out || of || money || when || you || want || things || like || new shoes
I || want || one more
pardon
I || want || one more toy
you || want || one more toy || what || you || like
a railway || set
a railway || set
do || you || mean to play || with || now || you || do || you || mean || youd || like || to buy
buy || one
oh || well
again || I dont || think || weve || got || any money || really || have || we || for || toys
Thomas dont || kick || that
I || hope || its one pence
oh itll || be || a lot || more than one pence Thomas || it || depends || what
which one || have || you || got || your eye || on
Ive || got || my eye || on || one thats || got || car barriers
car barriers
you || mean || like || the one || that || Clare || with || Jeannine || Dimitra
yeah
well || I || would imagine || thats || quite an expensive one
ask || Jeannine
ask || Jeannine
it || might be || one pound
well || it || might be || a pound || I doubt || it || very || because || I || think
but || I || think || maybe || Jeannines || bought || some more bits and pieces || to go
I || just || thought || because || were going || over
pardon
Mum I || just || want || this || to be || a different bank
alright || what || do || you || mean were going || over || were going || over || what

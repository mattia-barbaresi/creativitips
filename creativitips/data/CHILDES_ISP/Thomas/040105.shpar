where || shell || have || a tablet
she || wont be || tablet
and || its || come || with || some stamps || as well
it || has || somewhere || this little ink stamper

it || fits || in || that slot
because || you || were || really || quite young || when || we || got || that
theres || was || some glue || a little ink pad
that || could be || the glue

if || theres || anything
are || you
ooh
now
Ill || tell || you || what
oo
would || you || like to have
Im sad
why || you || sad
theres no letters || in || the letter box
well
perhaps || its &
shall || I || show || you
perhaps || nobodys || posted || anything || since || it || was last emptied
mhm
ah || dear
well
oh
I || see
Mum
someone || posting || something

I || do || as well
look
Im || just || out || for || a little stroll || I || think || Ill || post || this letter
okay
that || can go || in || first class
and || oh
one || with || the blue stamp || on || is || the second
that || actually || could be || an airmail stamp
its || got || a picture || of || an aeroplane || on || it
just || pretend || you || saw || through || the letter box
you || did || didnt || you
I || did
hello
ooh
goodness || me
laughs
its me
hello Mr Shop man
that || was || a shock
I || was just trying to post || my letters
0
now || Mr Shop man
watch || your head
laughs
could || we || have || a little
I || had || three tablets || for || that
right
well
youre || having || any more
could || we || please have || a little || look || in || your freezer cabinet || see
uh yeah
okay
would || you || like to come
uh no
I || dont
can || I || just || make || it || open
open
is || it
right
thank || you
um
its quite difficult
first || thing || I || come || to
that || was || lucky wasnt || it
yep
because || I || put || them || there || because || I || thought || someone || might want
did || you
did || you || think || somebody || would come || in || ask || you || to buy || some
mhm
pretend || you || have || Thomas || will || you
uh T uh || would
youre || doing || what || the post office lady || did || last night arent || you
would || you || like to see || in || it
yes please
okay
come || here
oh wow
because || Ive || emptied || all those letters
right
now || what || she
into || here
what || she || have || with || her
a scan
a scanner
scanned || it || from || there
right
you || scan || it || like || she || scanned
scan
scan
and || where || she || say || you || scanned || it
forgot
well || its so that
the cant || come || in
so || what || love
um || if || robbers || have got || the keys || then then || they || 'll
well
she || had || a || really really || huge bunch || of || keys didnt || she
and || she || said || theres || a different key || for || every letter box
because || then || if || the keys || are stolen
it || would take || somebody || a long long time || to work || out || which key
and || they || could probably set || up || a trap || catch || them
whereas if || one key || opened || all the boxes
then || the person || finding || the key || could whiz round || all || over || opening
and || the reason || she || scanned || it || was || because || she || cant || say || to || her boss
I || emptied || the post box || on || Chivington Drive
if || she didnt || because that || when || she || scans || it || it || transfers
but || also || its checking || the time || she empties || it
because || you || know || how || when || she || opened || it
on || the scanner thing
yeah
there || was || a little message || it || said || “ dont || forget to change
well
the tag || is || is || that || little um disc || that || says || one
two or three collections
do || you || know || the one || we || mean
when || we || look to see || which number
can || I || just || go || in || my little freezer uh || where || I || keep || bananas
ooh
yes
you dont || keep || freezers bananas || in || the freezer
and || when || those numbers || are || up
one
two and three
it || tells || you || the last time || the post || has been collected
so || I || think || for || us
here
if || number ones || up
it || means || the post || is collected || at || something || like || seven oclock || in
if || number two || is || up
its collected || at || quarter || past || eleven || in || the morning
if || number three || is || up
its collected || at || quarter || to || six || at || night
and || so || if || she || tries to collect || it || before || quarter || to || six
and || somebody posts letters || at || quarter || to || six
theyre || going to be || really really really || cross || if || shes || already
so || it || also || checks || that || shes || not emptying || the box || too early
because || wed be really annoyed || wouldnt || we
if || we || had || a birthday card || for || your friend
and || we || went || to || the box
and || it || was || my birthday
well
yes and || if || somebody thought rightq
well || post || Thomas || a card || now
thatll || get || there || in || the morning
and || when || they || got || to || the post box || the post || had already been
so || thats || what || she || said || its || for
its quite || a good idea || really || love
isnt || it

hope || that || bird didnt swing || under || his bum

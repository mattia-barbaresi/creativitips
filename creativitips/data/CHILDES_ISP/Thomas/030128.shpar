yes
in || the box
and || then || when || we || next || go || to || the station || we || know || where || they || are
now || if || we || build || a circular track
yeah
I || dont like build || a sker circle
I || want || ap || build || like || a snake
do || you
yeah
well || I || was thinking || if || we || do || the track || that || joined || up || all the way
yeah
then || the little train || that || moves || along || on || its own
yeah
wouldnt || fall || off
because at || the moment || sometimes || when || we || build || it || he || falls
he || falls || off || the end
th its not || fall || down || now
in || minute || might || Alice || might || bark
in || minute
in || a minute || what || lovey
em Alice || might || bark
oh || in || a minute Alice || might || bark
Alice
yeah
why || might || Alice bark || in || a minute
like || a circle
now
thats || right
I || think || you needta || put || it || more this way Thomas
because || we || havent got || enough track || do || that || have || we
its just a very long track isnt || it
oh || would || you || like || the engine || shed
yeah
at || the end || of || it

we || could put || that
well || it || needs to go || in || the track || on || two
like || this Thomas
no || it || dont
in || there || some

you cant || have || it
huh
right
better || to do || it || like || that
I dont wanna mess || up || this arrangement || though
because || this || is || really || nice

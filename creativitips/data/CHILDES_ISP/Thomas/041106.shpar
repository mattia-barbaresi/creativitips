we || all || will
and theyll || all || say || oh youre || tricking || me
yes well || I || was going to say || when || she
does die || you || tell || them
they wont || take || any notice
because || theyll || think || hes || just saying || it || for || sympathy
because || shes || already || dead
and youll || be upset || nobody || will bother
because || theyll all || think || youre || just making || it || up
but || Georgia wont
anyway || I || told || Jo || it || were || a fib
my cats || called

comes || down || from || the sky || the sausages
it || sounds || a very strange factory || for || to || me
sausages || coming || down || from || the sky
it doesnt || seem || right
a fire engine || flying
up || comes || the fire engine
must be || on || top gear || when || it || flies
well || Ive || never || seen || a fire engine fly
Ive || seen || sometimes
television pictures || of || when || theres
say || a bad forest fire
aeroplanes || sweep || very low
and || shoot || water || out || dont || they
they || jet || water || down
yep
but || Ive || never || seen || a fire engine
swinging || in || the sky || like || that
wocho look || where || its landing
its landing || at || the sausage factory
0
0
is || there || actually || a fire || at || the sausage factory
or || is || it || just putting || the oven || out
just || putting || the oven || out
well surely || it || would be || better just || to
turn || the oven || off || wouldnt || it
and || let || it || cool || down
you || really || need || the fire brigade || to come || out
yep
its very hard || to put || out || with || water
very hard || to put || out || with
our water
but || the fire brigades
so || does || this happen || every single day
that || the foot sausage factorys || working
yes and every time || its nearly finished
a fire engine || swoops || down
but || what || happens || if || theres || a cat || stuck || up || a tree
or || an accident || a proper fire
and || the fire engines || busy || putting || your
oven || out
is || that || dangerous
never || had || two fire engines || that || swooped || down
we || have || nine fire engines || that || swoop || down || on || our house
well || that || must be || very expensive
but || what || I || was meaning || was || if
if || there || was || a house fire
and || you || needed || the fire || in || an emergency || they
they || said || oh sorry the fire engines || busy
putting || the oven || out
and somebody || could be hurt
while || the fire engines || busy
fire engines
thats || here
you || seem to be having || more and more || fire engines
thats || why || everybody
uhoh Ive || got || a problem || putting || this || down
the ladders
just gently || dont || break || it || Thomas
I || think || Ive || already || broke
well
pass || it || to || me
just || do || it || gently
oh its || coming || off
well || dont
thats || it
thats || it
just very gently
slide || it || back || in
because || this || is || the only fire engine || with
ladders || that || works || now || isnt || it
hope || this || is || the same
well || you || like to pass || it || to || me Thomas
and || well || sort || it || out
rather than || forcing
neowo

seem to be || very stable fire engines
those toy fire engine ladders
a real firemans ladders || are || really stable
oh well || they || hafta || dont || they
at least || I || would hope || they || would be
this this || does seem to happen || with || all yours
and || I || dont || quite || understand || what || the problem || is
is || maybe || because || toys
they dont || hate being || your toys
coming
there || you || are fixed
kicho kocho kicho kocho
next time || I || will be || at || work this time
perhaps || the poor ladders || are worn || out || if || they
hafta || keep putting || the oven || out || in || your factory
mhm
they || go || in || fast reversing
could || imagine || ordinary fire engines proper fire engines
wouldnt hafta || use || the ladders || every time
because || some fires || that || they || go || to
they wouldnt needta use ladders
they || do || at || my sage
yes but thats || what || I || mean || if || they || hafta
put || the ladders || up || to put || your fire || out
every single day
poor ladders || are probably worn || out

Sergeant Major || was || patrolling || his garden
to make || sure || that || everything || was || straight
he || didnt || like || anything || that wasnt
straight square || even
he || would often do || a round || on || his hands
and || knees || measuring || the height || of || the grass
and || snipping || off || any blades || that || were || too high
one day || a butterfly || landed || on || one || of
Sergeant Majors daffodils || made || the
stem bend || a little
shoo butterfly || said || Sergeant Major || loudly
Sergeant Major || always || spoke || very loudly
because || hed been || in || the army || so long
stop bending || my flower
he || ordered
0
the butterfly || fluttered || off || to || Trampys garden
where || he || wouldnt be disturbed
mhm
in || Trampys garden nothing || was || straight
square || even
flowers and bushes || grew || just || how || they || wanted || to
the grass || was never cut
it || was || a very relaxed sort || of || garden
fence
there || were || no plants || hanging || over || the fence
between || Sergeant Major || Trampys garden
Sergeant Major || was || always || on || the look || out || for
any untidiness || coming || from || Trampys side || of || the fence
Sergeant Major || was || very pleased || to see || all
the tidiness and started
to march || around || the lawn
hup two three four hup || two three four
head || held || high arms || straight
a perfect example || of || a military man
Sergeant Major || hummed
as || he || strode || along
his arms || swinging
0
he || hummed marching || along || cheerfully
but || then || his concentration || was broken
by || a strange sound || coming || from || Trampys garden
a strange soft whistling sound
Sergeant Major || marched || to || the fence
whats || that || din || he || bellowed
Trampy
what || is || that racket youre making
Trampy || was sitting || in || an old deck chair || relaxing
he || was holding || a long thin musical instrument
he || held || it || up || for || Sergeant Major || to see
its a penny || whistle || he || said
a what
bellowed || Sergeant Major || a look || of || amazement || on || his face
a penny || whistle
replied || the relaxed Trampy || listen
he || put || the whistle || to || his lips
and || played || a little tune
that || was || like || a wind
like || the wind || tinkling || through || a crystal chandelier
0
thats
cant || you || play || any proper music || like || a good march
Trampy || stopped playing || looked || at || Sergeant Major
I || dont || like || marches || he || said
Sergeant Major || was || speechless
for || about three seconds
you || dont || like || marches || he || bellowed
in || a voice || that || was || even louder || than || before
well well || see || about || that
he || did || a smart || about || turn || marched || into || Drill hall
his house
and || Trampy
ugh
slu oh || is || that || a snail
yeah
Trampy || carried || on || playing
three butterflies || fluttered || by || in || time || to || the music
and || a snail || did || a very smooth
and || slipperly || sliding || slow step
in || Drill hall
oh
just || a minute || we || needta || stop || the tape Thomas
just one moment Id || forgotten

laughs
in || Tesco
you || ate || a sweet || in || Tesco
yeah
thats || stealing || Thomas
no but
no but nothing thats || stealing
the security guard || came || back || to || me || said || 0do
no I dont || think || he || would || Thomas
he || said || yeah
so || I || did
went || out || of || my sight || long enough || for || a security guard || to ask
laughs
seriously || Thomas || if || you || take || things || without || paying || for
doesnt matter || whether || its one sweet one
I || 0will || steal || you
listen || Im serious || if || the security man || had seen || you || you
it doesnt look || like || a prison
look 0like || my house
what sort || of || sweet did || you || take
that one
did anybody || see || you || take || it
mhm
is || that || when || you || ran || round || the corner
and || is || that || when || I || shouted come || here
hm
is || that || what || you || were doing
mhm
you || did || it || very quickly || didnt || you
mhm
thats || why || I || saved || it || when || we || came || home || I || thought || I
now || listen || I || didnt || see || you || do || that
I || know || you || went || round || the corner || I || shouted || you || came || back
dont || ever || do || that
I || mean || it || Thomas
do not do || that
in || future || you || hold || my hand || your hold Daddys hand || Nana
well || if || Im || lost || I dont
no you || hold || our hand || anyway
I || must see || where || you || are
because || listen || if || you || ran || round || that || corner || you || took || a
couldnt || they
mhm
but || please dont || do || things || like || that Thomas
I || know
I || know || its very tempting || when || all the sweets || are || there || youre
because || I || picked || you || up || from || school || then || we || went || to
no it wasnt Alphabet Zoo || it || was || Wacky Warehouse
and || then || we || went || to || Tesco || so || I || know || it || was || near || teatime
but || you || know || if || youd || been || so hungry || you || should have said || to || me
and || even then || I || couldnt have let || you || eat || something || with
dont
I || did tell || you
well || you || moaned || on || that || you || were || hungry || you || didnt say || please
please || Thomas dont || take || things || from || shops
youre lucky this time || that || the security man didnt || see || you
but || there || are || cameras || watching
course there isnt
there || is || Thomas
I || absolutely || promise || you || there || are || cameras || in || shops || watching
I || am not joking || now
I || know || I || joke || with || you || I || know || I || tease || you
no
Thomas || why || do || you || think || security men || are || there
theyre there || in || case || theres || any trouble || in || case anybody || takes
to keep || you || safe
to keep || other shoppers || safe || from || people || who || are stealing || sweets
thats || why || things || are || so expensive || in || the shops darling
because if || people || keep taking || things || without || paying || for || them
well || I || was going to say || a profit || you || wont || understand || that
the shop hasta || cover || its cost
what || does || that mean
well || that || means
yeah
they || sell || things || at || a price
and || if || everybody || goes || into || the shop || pays || that price || for
if || a few people dont pay
come || on
oh
well || Im || going to tell || you || this || anyway
you hafta || listen || now
huh
the shop hasta || take || enough pennies || in || its till || because || the shop
say || say || you || have || a factory || you || make || sweets
I || have got || a factory sweets
right
right || you hafta || find || money || to buy || all the ingredients || to
you || make || sweets || with
then || the delivery men || need paying || as well
you || glue
all delivery
when || the shop || decides || I || wanna || sell || some sweets
and || the factory || will say || such and such
thats such and such
well || say || twenty pounds
so || the shopman || pays || twenty pounds
now || the shopman || must make || sure || that || he || has || enough customers || to give
and || if || everybody || pays || theres || no problem
but || if || a few people dont || pay || then || he hasta || put || the price || up || really
now how || many times || have || we || been || out || you || said || “ || oh || I || want || that || ”
because || things || are || expensive || in || shops Thomas
oh
but || listen || just || before || you || go || more || to || the point
0
if if || the security man || a policeman || had seen || you || in || fact
now || you || imagine spending || a night || without || Mummy || in || a police station
all || because || youd || taken || one sweet

one one || of || those coins
those thick coins
the round ones
small
that || say || one pound
if || you || gave || a shopkeeper || one || of || those

I || know || sometimes || you || think || Im || mean || when || I || say || Mummy hasnt || got
when || you || work
if || youve || done || a good days || work || your boss || says well done
and || then || I hafta || make || those pennies || last || to pay || for || the house
all sorts || of || things

I hafta || go || do || some more work
theres || a saying money doesnt
and || it || doesnt
mhm
to work || for || money
and || only the people || with || money || can buy || things
wish || um || it || could grow || on || trees
well || I || wish || it || could grow || on || trees
but || it || doesnt
you hafta work || hard || for || money
and || you || can only buy || things || when || you || have || enough money
which || is || why || many many times || we || see || things || I || think || oh Id
Purdies

and || if || you || havent got || enough pennies || in || your purse || your pocket
but || you dont || know || if || its right || because || youd || say || have || I || got
well || thats || it || you || see
so || you couldnt || have || it || could || you
now || if || youd || taken || ten pl || it || was || nine pl || you || could have || it
what || if || it || was || two pound and youve || got || three pound
thats fine
you || give || them || three pounds || they || give || you || a pound change
or || youd || be || better just || giving || them || two pounds || keeping || a pound
mhm
but || no this || is || it || Thomas
you || can only buy || what || you || can afford || if || you cant || afford || it || you
okay
people || like || me
people || like || you
it doesnt matter || who || you || are
if || you || take || things || without || paying || for || it || thats || where || you || end
in || a nice home
no || in || a police cell
very || cross || with || you
they || wouldnt be || like || they || are || now
when || you || see || the policeman || they || say || hello son || how || are || you

hm
tell || you || a little story || now || Thomas
mhm
when || I || was || a little girl
mhm
I || went || shopping || in || York || with || Nana Bealby || we || went || to || a shop
and || you || know || Woolworths || in || Stockport
yeah
the toy shop
ah
remember || the toys
I || went || in || there || we || were walking || along || and || on || the floor
it || was || only a little thing
a tiny thing
and || I || picked || it || up || thought oh || I || like || the look || of || that
and || I || had || a dolls house || and || in || my dolls house || I || had || all sorts
and || this little piece || of || silver || that || stood || like || that
it || was || almost || like || um || you || know || the letter al
a triangle
yeah
it || was || almost || like || that || it || was || all made || of || metal
ever so tiny
and || it || was || so bright
I || could see || my face || in || it || I though || oh || that || would
so || I || picked || it || up
and || I || was || to put || it || in || my pocket || Grandma || Beably || saw
and || do || you || know || what || it || was
in || those days
you || know || how || now || you || have || little stickers || on || everything
yeah
a man || goes || round || with || his sticker gun || all the prices || are put || on
well || in || those days
it || happens || a lot || now as well
they useta || have || these little um sort || of || price tags || are
say || I || was selling || that
above || it || would be || a little piece || of || metal || the shopkeeper
and || these little metal things useta slide || along || the bar
and || I didnt || realize || what Id || picked || up || was || one || of || these little
so || I || thought || oh || its || just || a bit || of || bit || of || something || on || the
Ill || take || that || home || for || my dolls house || Nana Bealby || made || me
it || belonged || to || the shop
and || she || made || me || understand
I dont || know || what shes || said || to || me || Ive || never || forgotten || it
she || made || me || understand || from || a very early age || that || you dont
because || even || if || you || think || its nothing || if || its || in
0
but || if || someone || gives || me || it || in || 0the shop
oh || if || somebody || gives || you || it || in || the shop
I || mean || occasionally || we || go || to || shops
well || when || we || went || to || Mrs Sweets shop || do || you || remember || she || said
thats || totally || different
thats || the person || in || the shop || giving || it || to || you Thomas
usually || because || youve || been || a good boy
they dont || give || naughty boys
you || know || rowdy boys sweets
but || you || never || take || anything
red
red yellow yellow
yeah
I || think || what || well || do || next time || we || go || shopping
what
you || know || the little toy purse || that || we || brought || from || Spain
well || its not || a toy purse || its a real purse || that || we || brought
when || we || next || go shopping || well || put || some proper money || in || there
and || when || we || go || to || a shop || buy || something || you || can pay
and || then || you || can see || how much change || you || get
because at || the moment || you || always || come || to || the till || with || me || we
always always || pay || for || things sweetheart
yeah
yeah
then || I || can keep || the money
cant I
and || then || put || it || in || my moneybox
you || can || if || you || get || any change
right
I || love || you
I || love || you
I dont || want || you || in || prison
what || we || play

we didnt play || in || Isabels || sandpit || this morning
we didnt || take || the cover || off || last
ooh babies

Isabels sandpit || was shaped || like || a shell || it || had || two halves
one half || was filled || with || sand || the other half || had || nothing || in || it
and || we || closed || up || it || folded || up || made || a lid
oh || dear
but || you || could have || sand || in || both sides or water || in || both sides
or || sand || in || one and water || in || the other
and || last week || when || we || went || to || Bethanys house || she || had || a sandpit
but hers || was || actually || an old pond || built || in || the garden wasnt || it
and || they || drained || it || of || water || filled || it || with || sand

weve || seen || one
Bow juice

its water
weve || seen || one sandpit || that || looks || like || a table || with || some small
you || can either have || it || as || a table || take || the legs || off || it || can
I || think || that || might be || quite good || because || I || think
poo shoes
are || you || taking || my shoes || off
I || think || if || its || on || little legs || it || might stop
because || pussycats || like || playing || in || sandpits
oh dont || you || start tickling || my feet || I || shall be giggling
are || you || having || a liedown || now
so || look || Thomas

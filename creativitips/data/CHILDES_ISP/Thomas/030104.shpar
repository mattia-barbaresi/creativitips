when || it || broke || although || weve || got || some big pieces || of || plate || like
think || Daddy 0will fix || it

I || think || we || had || better just || put || it || in || the bin Thomas
when || it || shattered || even though || it || broke || in || big pieces || there
let || me || show || you || one
that || are || very very sharp
and || if || theyve || landed || on || Purdies water || bowl || then || it isnt || very
so well || get || rid || of || the water
look || at || that
oh yeah
thats || a little piece || of || broken pot
in || fact Auntie Mabel || broke || a teapot || the other day didnt || she
yeah
what || happened || then
did || Pippin run and bump || into || her || she || dropped || it
go || crasho
she hadta || go || to || the shop || buy || another one didnt || she
then || they || said || they || selled || them
and || they didnt || sell || them
no
I || think || her nephew || sent || her || a teapot || in || the post || for || a birthday
a nice brown teapot
it || looked || like || ours
and || then || I || think || Pippin || got excited || because || the postman || arrived
and || Pippin || was running || round Auntie Mabels legs || she || tripped || up
no
and || she || was || upset
well || what || happened
um || jumped || on || his hand
0
did did || Pippin jump || onto || Auntie Mabels hand
no
ap teapot
jumped || out || of || her hand
yeah
and || Auntie Mabel || was || a bit || worried || because || the nephew || who || bought
because || she || thought || “ gosh || I || dont want || him || to know || Ive || broken
so || she || rushed || to || the shop || to buy || a replacement || one || the lady
itll || be || next week
and || Auntie Mabel || said || I || cant || wait || that long
so || what || she || do
dont || know
where || she || go || to || with || Pippin
another factory shop
she || went || to || the factory shop didnt || she
and || bought || one || there
and || then || when || her nephew || arrived || at || the door Pippin || got || so

you || know || just || where || to stop || Thomas || laughed || his driver
you || could almost manage || it || without || me
Thomas || had become conceited
he didnt || realize || that || his driver || was joking
you wont || do || you || know || what || conceited || means
yeah
it || means || he || became || very very smug || very sure || of || himself
later || he || boasted || to || the others
the driver || says || I || dont || need || him || now
dont || be || daft || snorted || Percy
Id || never || go || without || my driver || said || Toby || earnestly
Id || be || frightened
poohq || boasted || Thomas
Im || scared
youd || never || dare said || the other engines
I || would though boasted || Thomas
youll || see
hes || a bit || show || off || is || Thomas isnt || he
wheres || the driver
well || I || think || this || is || what || the problem || is
Thomas || has decided || hes || going to go || without || his driver
next morning || the firemen || came
Thomas || drowsed || comfortably || in || the shed || as || the warmth || spread || through
Percy and Toby || were || still || asleep
Thomas || opened || his eyes || then || he || suddenly || remembered || silly
Ill || show || them
the driver hasnt || come || yet so || here || goes
he || cautiously || tried || one piston || then || the other
Ill || just || go || out || Ill stop || go whoosh
thatll || make || them || jump
very
Thomas || thought || that || he || was being || clever
but || really || he || was only moving || because || a careless cleaner || had
look
he || looking || down
he || is || isnt || he
what || for
a smile || on || his face hasnt || he
mhm
it || says || Thomas || thought || that || he || was being || clever
but || really || he || was only moving || because || careless a careless
he || soon || found || out || his mistake
he || tried || to || whoosh || he couldnt
he || tried to stop || he couldnt
he || just || kept rolling || along
the buffers || will stop || me || he || thought || hopefully
but || the siding || had || no buffers
Thomass wheels || left || the rails || crunched || the tarmac
there || was || the station masters house
Thomas didnt || dare to look || at || what || was coming || next
the station master || his family || were || just || to have || breakfast
horrorsq || cried || Thomas || shut || his eyes
there || was || a crash
and || the house || rocked || broken glass || tinkled
plaster || peppered || the plates

oh
I || was going to say || I || dont || think || it || actually || shows || you || oh
Gordon || uh pull || tree || on || the line

I || think || its Thomas || has smashed || into || the fat controllers house
a little bit || like || when || that plate || broke
what || it || say || on || the previous page
crasho
crasho
lets read || it || again
there || was || a crash
and || the house || rocked || broken glass || tinkled
plaster || peppered || the plates
that || means || that || probably || plaster || from || the ceiling || fell || down
yeah
oh look
and Thomas || had collected || a bush || on || his travels
he || peered || anxiously || into || the room || through || its leaves
oh
the station master || was || furious
the station masters wife || picked || up || her plate “ || you || miserable
just || look || at || what youve || done || to || our breakfast
now || I || shall hafta cook || some more
oh
she || banged || the door
more plaster || fell
this time || it || fell || on || Thomas
you || see || all the dust and rubble || from || the ceiling
yeah
oh Thomas || felt depressed
that || means || he || felt || very sad
mhm
when || youre || depressed || youre || very sad
yes
Thomas || felt depressed
the plaster || was || tickly
he || wanted to sneeze || he || didnt dare || in || case || the house || fell || on
nobody || came || for || a long time
everyone || was || much || too busy
what || happened || there
well || he || crashed || into || the station masters house didnt || he
because || he || thought || he || was || clever enough || to go || on || his own || without || a
and || he || wasnt
and || he || got || into || trouble || when || he || found || he couldnt stop
what all || of || that rope || for
pardon
that
the rope
well || I || think || theyre || obviously going || to || hafta || try and pull || him || out
now || listen || Thomas
you || know || sometimes || when || we || go || out || of || the front door
yeah
and || you || start running || away || I || shout stop
now || the same sort || of || thing || could happen || to || you
you || think || “ oh || I || can go || down || there || with || Mummy ”
its perfectly safe I dont || need || Mummy
but || you || do || sometimes || Thomas
because || sometimes || things || happen
if || youre || running || quickly || you || couldnt stop || a car || was
yeah
so || its always better || to wait || isnt || it
like || Thomas || should have waited || for || his driver
you || should wait || for || Mummy
right
so now || what || has happened
it || says || Thomas || was saying || nobody || came || for || a long time
but || it || looks || now || as if || some workmen || have come
whats || that || hook || there
well || normally || I || would imagine || thats || the hook
listen || to || the trains || this morning
I cant || get || over || that
I || wonder || if || theres || something special || going || on
theyre all || going || poop poop
I || think || that hook || would normally couple || the engine || to || the
the last workman || propped || up || the house || with || strong poles || laid
that || must be || like || scaffolding || that || we || see || on || building sites || holding
yeah
just || a minute
I
not || if || you || wanna turn || the page
do || you wanna || see || whats || going || on || underneath
no I
do || you || know || who || they || are
yeah
who || are || they
dont || know
theyre twins
Donald || Douglas
we || we || met || them || in || another story || at || Christmas
oh whats || that || one || called
well || I dont || know || theyre || identical
but || well || call || that || one Donald || that || one Douglas
I || dont know || which || is || which
Im sure || they || have || different numbers || on || the engines
are || they number || nine || ten or ten || eleven
something || like || that
we || came || across || them || at || Christmas Thomas
in || that story || about || Thomas || the Christmas tree
because || Donald and Douglas || were || the ones || who || shunted
at || last workmen || propped || up || the house || with || strong poles
and || laid || rails || through || the garden
Donald and Douglas || arrived
ah || they || must be || Scottish
because || theyre || saying || theyre || saying || something || about || “ || well
but || they || way || its written || it || sounds || “ || well soon || have || you || back
I || cant do || the accent
puffing || hard || the twins || managed to haul || Thomas || back || to || safety
so || I || think || that train || is || onto || Thomas
and || look || it || must be || on || the back || of || Donald and Douglas
bits || of || fencing || the bush || a broken window frame || festooned
that || means || they || were || over || Thomass front
which || was badly twisted
he || looked || very funny
Thomas || was || in || disgrace
but || there || was || worse || to come
that || means || Thomas || is || in || a lot || of || trouble
you || are || a very naughty engine || came || a voice
“ || I || know || Sir ” || said || Thomas
Im || sorry || Sir
Thomass voice || was muffled || behind || his bush
look
can || you || see
he || has got || a bit || of || bush || all sorts || on || his face
0
you || must go || to || the works || have || your front end || mended
it || will be || a long job || said || the fat controller
“ oh yes Sir ” || faltered || Thomas
meanwhile || a Diesel rail car || called || Daisy || will do || your work
I || think || that || happened || before || didnt || it
Daisy || stepped || into || the the breach || before || hasnt || she
when || something || has happened || to || Thomas
diesel Sir
Daisy Sir Thomas || spluttered
yes Thomas || said || the fat controller
diesels || always || stay || in || their sheds till || they || are wanted
diesels || never || gallivant || off || to || breakfast || in || Station Masters houses
the fat controller || turned || on || his heels || sternly walked || away
oh gosh
now || I || think || that || should teach || Thomas
laughs
another one
that || should teach || Thomas || a lesson shouldnt || it
he || should not have gone || off || on || his own || he
no no
so
and || Thomas || you || must learn || from || that story

she wouldnt || get || one || for || another week || so || she || went || the factory
and || it || showed || them || pouring || clay || into || moulds
and || after || they || had poured || the clay || into || moulds || they || baked || the
and || then || they || dipped || it || in || a brown glaze || fired || it || again || in || the
and || it || came || out || all brown and shiny || Auntie Mabel || said || “ || just

and || she || was talking || to || one || of || the workmen || he || said || “ || oh || you cant
something hasta || be added || to || it

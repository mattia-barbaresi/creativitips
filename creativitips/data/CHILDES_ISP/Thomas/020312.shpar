not || yellow boxes
letterboxes
but theyre gold || colored || arent || they
ap || shut || ap door

so || you || say || yellow boxes || partly || because of || the color || I || think
and || when || we || go || for || a walk || you || wanna || post things || through || peoples
and Mummy || said || we || cant || do || that
so || what || we || do
we || come || here || to || our front door || we || post || some letters || through
and || then || we || open || the door
come || in
pick || the letters || up || off || the mat
go || back || outside
shut || the door
and || then || post || them || back || through || the box dont || we
0
and || then occasionally || we || go || down || to || the big red post box
big red
but || we || cant do || that now
weve || got to play || inside

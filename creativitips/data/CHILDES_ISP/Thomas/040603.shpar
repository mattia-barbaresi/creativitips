I || suppose || if || you || wanna finish || off || in || the conservatory || we || can
is || it || your train || tracks set || up || in || there

mhm
Ill || just || finish || up
more cereal
ooh
orange lights || on || the machine

0
suppose || it || is || on || warning
and || that breakdown truck flashes || to warn || us
hm
somethings || broke || down
mhm
thats || the same || as || this isnt || it

when || this flashes || it || means || somethings || causing || a problem
we || usually || know || what || it || is || dont || we
mhm

orange marmalade
0

Ill || put || another piece || in
I || was just doing || something || through || there

see
no apples
I || have
yes
have || you || seen || that woman || peeping || through || the window
yeah
weve || got to get || a lot || yet || though || havent || we
mhm
we || just || hope || nothing || eats || them || because || you || know
oh gosh
that || was || the toaster
that || really || frightened || me
I || thought || Id || been || shot
you || know || um Nana Bilbey || grows || lots || of || apples
yeah
well || a lot || of || them || fall
because || shes || got || so many
a lot || of || them || fall || off || the tree
these look || like || theyve || dropped
no
well || shes || got || a lot || of || trees || hasnt || she
and || then || when || they || fall || down
yes
often || little slugs and things || eat || them
we || get || a lot || of || slugs
I || just || hope || that || doesnt
Sainsburys

pardon
Sainsburys
Sainsburys

but || its a blue tshirt
with || an orange logo || on || it
its not ours
its || on || somebody elses || washing || line isnt || it
no
we || have || a lot || of || slugs || the thing || is || I || think || the difference || is
a lot fall || down || between || her picking || them || up
and || so || the slugs || get || on || the ground
I dont || think || anybody || would necessarily climb || up || to || the tree
wasps || might like || apples || I || think || uh
yeah
there || are || wasps || around || at || the moment arent || they
there || are and theyre || big
what the apples || are || big
hm
yeah
well
Ive || sometimes || seen || wasps || on
you || know || apples || that || have gone || very ripe || are || a bit || soggy

0
ow
and || what || did || man || do || on || the telly
sometimes || the big ones hafta
yes
the little ones || fall || off || because || the big ones needta || grow
the little ones || fall || off || so || the big ones || can grow

Im
Annie Apple
I dont || look || like || an apple || do || I

0
it || goes || bonkq

Mum
yes
Gwens || got || a bigger bottom || than || you
who || has
Gwen
Gwen
yep
oh now || Thomas
dont || say || that
yes
well
its not nice || to make || comments || about || peoples || shape
or || size
a bottom || of || lies
no
but || its not nice Thomas
because || I dont mind || it || doesnt matter || who || you || are
theres || usually || something || about || you || youd || like || to change || if || you
you || know
the color || of || your hair
the shape || of || your nose
your size
and || you || cant
its || just || the way || we || are
were || all different
and || some people || are || bigger || than || others
and || its not kind || when || you || start making || comments || because || a lot || of
I || mean || Id || like || to look || a lot slimmer
I || wish || my hair wasnt || as || grey
I || wish || lots || of || things
but || no
thats || the way || we || are
I || I || wish || um || the house || was made || of || sweets
0
ooh
there || you || are
you || see
just || make || do || with || what youve || got
well || you dont hafta || make do
youve || got to make || the most || of || it
its || like || that lady || said || to || me || in || Marks and Spencers || the other day
what
when || I || was buying || something
I || said || to || her || that || it || made || me || realize || how || big Id || got || because || a
they || would look || really nice || on || somebody || like || Thomas
you || know
somebody tall and slim
somebody || tall
sit || up || properly
tall and slim and young
and || I || said || to || her || it || makes || me || realize || how || Ive || changed
because || I || just || wouldnt be || able || to fit || into || things || like || that any
and || she || said || you || do || Madam || is buy || it || in || a bigger size and wear
there || you || are
and || she || was || more or less || saying || it || doesnt matter
as long || as || you || feel || good || in || it || you || dont || care || what || other people
and || its true
when || you || look || around || you || see || all sorts || of || different people
but || you || know || at || the end || of || the day Thomas
were || very lucky || that || we || can see
that || we || can hear
that || were || poorly
that || we || can run || around
I || mean look || at || the way || you || run || around
and || ride || your bike and things || some children cant walk
some children || are || in || hospital || because || theyre || poorly
some || are starving || with || no food
I || mean || yes
you || know
you || might want || a few things || when || you || think || about || it || youre
youve || got || a nice roof || over || your head
youre warm and snug || at || night and youve || got || plenty || to eat
and || when || youre poorly || weve || got || medicine || that || really || is || all
Mum
and youve || got || friends
Mum
when || the poor people || wake || up || say
Mum || I || have || some breakfast
say || whats || for || breakfast
nothing
no
thats || right
you || see || they || probably || get || to || the stage || where || they || dont even ask
because || they || just || know || theres || no food
you || imagine || that
you || know || when || you || feel || a little bit peckish || your tummy || starts
you || imagine going || for || days and days and days || without || food
or || when || you || do drink || water
sometimes || it || can make || you || poorly || because || its not clean
I || mean || I || know || there || are || a lot || of || children || have || more toys || than || you
they || have || a bigger house || than || you
oh
they || maybe || go || on || on || big holidays and things || which || we dont || do
at || the end || of || the day
the most important things || in || life || are || what youve || got
and || a lot || of || children dont || have || any || of || those
a lot || of || children || have || fancy cars || big houses
and lots || of || toys || their mum and dads dont || love || them
nobody || could love || people || more || than || you
I || didnt say || that right
more nobody || could be loved || more than you || is || what || I || mean
Mummy couldnt love anybody || more || than || she || loves || you
and || thats || very important
I || know || I || get cross || with || you
0
but || at || the end || of || the day youre || my precious little boy
and || Id || do || anything || for || you
you || know || that || dont || you
laughs
oh || dear
what || made || you || think || of || a donkey || when || I || went || through || all that
laughs
laughs
not || only || you || Purdie || is || a lucky cat
0
why
most cats || are || pampered || like || Purdie || is
pampered
what 0does || pamper mean
pampered || means spoilt || to || death Thomas
laughs
Im sure || it || doesnt || quite mean spoilt || to || death
but || she || is
not many cats || live to be || nineteen
and || shes || got || there || because || shes || absolutely spoilt || to || death
laughs
I || know || why
ah
meow
because || Mummy || loves || her || as well
I || shout || down || her ear
well
shouting || down || her ear || is || nice
but || she cant || really || hear || a lot || can || she || now
she || still || knows || we || love
because || we || still || feed || her || we || cuddle || her || stroke || her
and || shes || got || a nice clean bed || we || let || her || go || in || the sun
and || we || let || her || in and || out || when || she || wants
and || Purdies || got || everything
we || let || her || have || cat food || when || she || wants
thats || right
yes
and || a lot || of || pussycats dont || have || food
and || they hafta || go || outside || catch || mice
and || birds || anything thats || hanging || around
mind || you
in || fairness Purdie || was || a stray cat || when || we || got || her
she didnt || have || a nice life
when || I || got || her || she || was || very injured
very poorly
she || was badly injured
she || was || hungry
she || was covered || in || fleas
she || was || a real mess
I || think || she || was || frightened
because || she || was frightened || to || death || of || the noise || of || water
and || she || was frightened || of || ladies
she didnt mind men || she || didnt || like || ladies
didnt || like || me
ooh no
did || she || like || me
dont || know
she || didnt seem to like || anybody || look || at || her || now
all these years || later
and || thats || because || weve || given || her love
havent || we
and || careness
kindness
careness
kindness
weve || cared || for || her
yum yum
piece || of || toast
there || you || are
have || you || finished || your cereal
dessert
dessert
its a piece || of || toast || with || orange marmalade || on || it
with || no carrot
well || its not carrot
its finely shredded orange peel isnt || it
right
it || looks || like || a
oh || theres || no margarine || on || that darling
did || you || want || margarine || on || it
sweeter
because || I dont || have || margarine || on || my toast
I || just || put || marmalade || on || it
but || because || I || was talking || to || you || I didnt || eat || it || up
and || you || pinched || it
I || think || the other thing || is || Thomas
you || never || really || know || what || happens
no
dont || you || do || that
you dont || actually || know || what || happens || to || people
which || is || why || you || should always be || very kind || to || people
because || sometimes even || though || people || put || on || a brave face
maybe || at || nursery || even || at || school
or || on || the bus
or || in || the street
do || you || see || people || theyre nice and chatty || very cheerful
but || sometimes
do || you || remember || that lady || in || Marks and Spencers || who || spoke || to || us
when || we || were having || a meal
and || she || came || up || to || me || Daddy || said
ooh || you || are || lucky || to have || a baby
I || mean || she || was || an elderly lady || she || said
I || I || could never have || children
and || I dont || think || theyd || give || me || one || now || when || Im seventy
and || do || you || know
she || chatted || to || us || perhaps || were || the only people || that || she || spoke
and || shes || obviously || very sad || sometimes
but || she || was || nice and pleasant || when || we || met || her
and || this || is || it
you || never || actually || know || what || a lot || of || people
Im || that monkey
whos || that || monkey
oh || yes
thats || the box || we || brought || back || from || Marks and Spencers
I || am || the monkey
you || know || sometimes || you || never || know || what people
whats || happening || to || people || at || home
you || know
they || might not be || very happy || when || they || get || home sometimes
so || you || always || try and be || nice || to || people
because || even || if || people havent || got || a lot || of || toys
or || sometimes || at || home people dont || love || them
or || sometimes || theyre || a little bit || hungry or cold
you || can always be || pleasant || to || people || nice || to || them cant || you
mhm
yes
yep
that || doesnt cost anything || to be || nice || to || people || does || it
right
Ive || just || got to go and flip || the button || on || the machine || through || here
heres one || of || our friends
there || we || are
heres one || of || our friends
now || heres || our friend
uh
hello pussycat
mimiouwo
miouwo
miouwo
miouwo miouwo
miouwo
and || you || see || Purdies || so || spoilt || Thomas
that || even though || shes || got || some food || left || from || last night
she wont || eat || it
because || shes || a snobby pussycat
fresh
she || likes || fresh
but || what || we || do
we || trick || her || a little bit
because || this food || from || last night || is || perfectly alright
if || its || dried || up
which || happens || sometimes || if || its a very hot day
I wouldnt || give || it || to || her
but || this hasnt || dried
so || what || I || do || is scrape || it || onto || a fresh plate
mix || it || with || a little bit || of || fresh
and || shes || none || the wiser
she || is || sometimes though
she || realizes || sometimes || thats || when || we || hafta put || in || the crunchy
did || you || have || a nice time || outside || Puss
did || you || have || a nice time
did || you || have || a nice time
oh shes || not going to talk || to || us Tom || today
oh
oops || a daisy
there || you || are
0
theres || your breakfast
there || you || are
you || see
shes || noticed
thats clever isnt || it
thats || a clever trick
laughs
well || its too expensive
oops
its one puss || that || just || fell || over
thats || too || expensive to throw || away
I || mean || its only || a little bit || uh || you cant waste food || like
are || you || likely || to want || more toast Thomas || after || that
likely
no
likely no
0
right
well
this || is || my first piece
so || Ill || put || another piece || in || for || myself
but || if || youd || like || it
you || can have || it
now just || while || were talking || about || things || like || that Thomas
I || know || there || are || times || when || I || get cross
and || when || I || shout || when || you || think || Im || being mean
but || you || know just think || on
that || we || all || have || days || when || things dont || go || quite right
or || we cant || have || what || we || want
but || at || the end || of || the day weve || still || got || an awful lot || more things
havent || we
oops || a daisy
what || you || like
if || you || could have || anything || in || the world
what || you || like
hallelujah

0
we || not || go
0
oh Purdies || having || a little sneeze
have || you || noticed || she || does || this || after || shes || eaten || now
licking || her big whiskers
0
you || know || why || cats || have || whiskers Thomas dont || you
no
well || they || can feel || with || them
theyre || very || sensitive
and whiskers || are || as wide || as || Purdies body
and || what || it || means || if || she || was going || through || a hole
if || she || was going || into || something
and || her whiskers || touched || the edges
she || would think || uhoh
Im || going to get stuck
because if || my whiskers dont wont || go || through || my fat bits
come || on || Puss
0
now
off || you || go
bye bye
bye Puss
0
0
and || they || have || them || on || the top || of || the head || for || the height || as well
for || the same reason
and || do || you || know || what || Grandad Bilbey || did || when || he || was || a little boy
this || was || very very cruel
he || cut || his pussycats whiskers || off
laughs
and || that || was || cruel
that || was || dangerous
but || his pussycat || could then of gone and got stuck || in || a hole
Im sure theyd || grow || back || again
no
he || was told || it || was || lucky || to find || a cats whisker
if || ever || I || find || one || of || Purdies || on || the floor
I || pick || it || up || I || keep || it
give || me good luck
then || you || stick || it || back || together

do || you || think || your trains || a little bit || big Thomas

why || dont || you || make || two smaller trains
or || have || the express || as || one train
dont || want
or || make || the other other carriages || into || another train
uh
you || always || wanted to know || which train || is coming
that || your lunch

you dont || want || this little one
Mum

does || it
the Intercity || express || train || to bring || my lunch || quickly
that || would be || good wouldnt || it

a number
in || front || of || you
and || youre || under || arrest
no
it doesnt || go || in there
yes
it || does
if || you || press || the hat
press the policemans hat
I || know
where || his hand lands
look
it || says
yeah
roadblock
well || we cant || have || a roadblock || because || weve weve um
right
it || says take || a roadblock || off
so || we || each || have || a car
the orange
I || want || you || to have || the blue one
Im gonna || take || the
well
no
wait || a minute
I || havent || no

just || be || patient || please
right
which car || are
which || to be
rrro
blue
right
well
you || needta || park || the blue car || on || this || which || is start and finish
Ill || be || the one
over || there
right
now || you || wait || a minute
brrmo
brrmo
what || are || those two signs
well
that || says start and finish
but || thats || for || if || weve || got || four players
but || we || havent
weve only || got || me || you
two players
right
you || start
now || spin || the hand
thats || it
just once || Thomas
press || it || let go
right
now || its || now || we cant || do || that
add || a roadblock
add || a roadblock
no
we cant || add || anything || at || the moment || because || we || havent got
just || press || again

youve || got to go || up or down or sideways
right
there
one
two
three
wrong
wrong
right
now || its Mummys turn || to || policeman
it || says add || a roadblock
right
so || Ive || got to put || the roadblock || back || on || there
think || that || might block || you
and || I || think || the quickest person || that || manages to get || across || to
it || says || each person || collects || a car || places || it || on || the start
well
weve || done || that
each player || then || takes || it || in || turns || to spin || the policeman
the player || with || the highest number starts
oh
I || see
right
we didnt || do || that properly
each player || takes || a turn || to spin || the policeman || then || moves || the
as || indicated || by || his hand
so youve || got to go || in || the direction || of || the policemans hand
cars || can only move || forwards
backwards || sideways
they cannot travel || diagonally
the player || then || adds or removes || a roadblock || as || indicated || by || the
or || clear their own
but || beware || of || which roadblock || you || take || away
you || could be blocked || again || at || the next turn
oh
and || the first player || to drive || from || start || to finish || is || the winner
hm
right
what || what || does || the winner || get
a lolly
yeah
probably
yeah
hope || I || win
I
alright
well || you || do
grr
it || must be || it
0
yeah
oh
right
places
move || the number || of || squares || as indicated || by || his hand
then || it || says || the player || then || hasta remove || a roadblock || as || indicated
one
right
two
three
four
five
yes
so actually || its this hand || that || must be || the pointer || for || the the
this || is || the one || that || tells || you || this || is || the way || to move || the
right
no
you || dont || cheat
you || press || his hat || right
now || hes || telling || me || to move || four
whats || he || saying
knock || a roadblock || off
and || move || three places
Ive || got to move || in || this direction
is || that right

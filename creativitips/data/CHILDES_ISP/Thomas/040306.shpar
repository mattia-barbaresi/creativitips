when || Im || putting || polish || on || these shoes

did || you || know
is || the tape || on
I || hope || so
why
pants
its alright
were || alright || because || were talking || about || pants
were || being || rude || are || we

might not mean its very old though || does || it
yes || it || does
does || it
its dirty its been there || a long time
has || it
oh || do || you || want || it

did || you || know
no
have || you || taken || one || outside || dropped || one
might have dropped || one
are || you || coming || to || your train || now
I || am || yes
Mum this || could be || your suitcase
Thomas || when || did || the
oh I || thought || they || were
I || was || just || to say || when || did || the rubbish men || come
but || they || havent been || have || they
Mum
that || theyve || cleared || them || all
this || could be || your suitcase
yes || it || could couldnt || it
I || like || that || for || a suitcase
because || it || looks || like || its || got || a lot || of || money || in || it
has || it
um || closed or folded || up || like || money
right
okay
were using || a till || for || the suitcase arent || we
do || you || know || what Im watching
I || thought || the bin men || had collected || all the bags
yeah
because || the bags || have moved || from || outside || of || the house
but || they || the other side || of || the road
whos || having || a look || in || the bucket || the bin bags
I || think || it || might be || um naughty magpie
naughty magpie
and || what || happened || last week || to || the
do || you || remember || all the bin bags || near || Janes house
I || think || something || went || peck || peck
something || went peck || peck
and || ripped || open all the bin bags
left || an awful mess
I || think || actually || it || might have been || a fox
rather || than || a magpie Thomas
because || there || was || such a lot || of || damage wasnt || there
we || watch || magpies || chomping || away || on || the bin bags
at || the back || of || the house
you || know || Battersbys || live
mhm
but || um || I || mean || those || were || just just || pecks || in || the bags
but || outside Janes house
absolutely everything || had been & un
uncovered || from || the bag hadnt || it
hm || they || must have thought
pardon
they || must have thought
there || might be || a dog || fast asleep
and || they || might not want || it
do || you || think || a fox || was looking
for || a dog || fast asleep || in || the bin bag
no
a cat
for || a pussy cat
well || Id sooner || think || that somebody || had thrown || something || out
like || some chicken
tuna or something || that || they || hadnt finished
and || that || would smell || very very attractive wouldnt || it
to || a fox

because || we || do || you || remember || the last time || we || went || to || Piccadilly

mhm
we || saw || that lady || with || all her || suitcases
sitting || in || a sort || of || luggage cart
do || you || remember
and || the guard || was || along
mhm
I || bet || she || was embarrassed || actually
because || she || looked || quite funny didnt || it
but || was || the guard || pulling
not
oh no
the guard wasnt || pulling || it
no
it || was || um || it || was || a little truck
but || the lady || the passenger
was sitting || with || the guard || in || the front
and || she || had || all her || suitcases || in || the back
and || it || was trundling || along
and || normally || you || just || see || a driver
pulling || a cart load || of || um suitcases
but || only this time || he || had || a passenger || as well
so || I || imagine || the lady || was || very grateful
mhm
she didnt || look || as || if || shed be || able || to walk || very far
and || um || you || know || poor guard || on || his own
he couldnt || of || carried || all her || suitcases
and || she || certainly || couldnt || carry || them

just || bring || your um || you || get || a taxi
and || Ill || bring || your luggage
right
so || if
have || you || seen || my truck
outside || your house
but || I dont || think || you || can bring || the railway truck
on || the road || outside
I || think || youd || have
oh yes || I || can
my stations || at || Piccadilly
oh || is || it
there || is || a Piccadilly || in || London isnt || there
up || at || Piccadilly
oh || right
well || theres || Piccadilly || in || Manchester
thats || the one Im || in
so || I || can easily get || it || the road
broomc
but || Im || at || Piccadilly || in || London arent || I
I || thought || Id || arrived || in || London
you || have
well || you || see || if || I || hailed || a taxi
if || I || put || my hand || up || get || a taxi
then || Im sure all my luggage || would go || in || the taxi
and || the taxi driver || would take || me || to || the hotel
and || then || when || I || got || there
either || the taxi driver || would help || me
or || the porter || at || the hotel || would help
but || your luggage || is || at || your house || now
but || I || thought || I || was going || to || London || on || holiday
a flat
my hotel
yep
oh || right
well || youve been || a very very kind train driver
Ive || never || come || across || such a helpful train man || before
um no doubt || you || want || a very big tip || do || you
mhm
Im || tipping || it || into || the house
tipping || it || into || the house
oh
but || I || was meaning || a tip
when || you || give || somebody || a tip
like || a taxi driver || a porter
its || when || you || think || a waiter || when || you || think
theyve || done || a really good job
when || you || think || theyve || served || you || well
and || you || just || give || them || a little bit || extra money
you || pay || the bill
you || pay || them || whatever || you || owe || them || for || the bill
and || then || you || say || “ youve || done || a jolly good job well done ”
and || give || them || a little bit || extra
and thats || called giving || a tip
so || Im || going to give || you || a tip
because || I || have never come || across || a worker
whos || worked || so hard || with || my luggage || before
let || me || open || my purse
well || here || we || are
theres || some money || here
look
there || you || are
theres || a five pound note
oh thanks
thats || quite alright
youve || done || a jolly good job
do || you || do || this || for || all your passengers
not || often
not || often
no
and || what || was || so special || about || me
that || you || thought || youd || help || me || with || mine
hm I || just || thought || Id || be || kind
to || people
you || thought || youd || be || kind || to || people
mhm
oh thats || nice
has || somebody been || very kind || to || you
mhm
no
its || because
and || this hotel
oh || right
a woman || with || um lots || of || luggage
oh || right
well || I || suppose
was || probably || being || kind || to || somebody || once
and || uh theyve || give || you || a very nice tip
and youve || thought || “ oh thats || much || better || than || people || being || grumpy ”
and not || giving || me || any money
so Ill || be || kind || to || everybody || at || work
its || like || I || say || Thomas
if || you || are || pleasant || to || people
if || you || are || nice and kind and polite
they || are || the same || back arent || they || usually

how || they || get || this
well || what || happens
I || mean || Mummy doesnt || you || know || when || we || occasionally
collect || for || things

what || you || do || is
you || pop || an envelope || through || somebodys door

um “ || please help || us || to continue || our work ”
every penny || you || give || to || cancer care || makes || a difference

when || you || chop || your fingers || off
mhm
and || you || wont be seeing || sympathy || from || me

I || didnt
I || was just showing || you || where || to rub

probably never || bother grating || it || again
its only a tiny bit || anyway
if || you || grated || all this
mhm
oh yes || if || you || grated || all that
it || would uh make || quite a a big pile
of || grated sausage

with || scarves || round || their necks

a scarf || for || my funnel
and || he || kept saying
I || want || a scarf
and || one day
I dont || know || what || happened
he || was showing || off || a bit wasnt || he
I || think || he || useta come || to || the station
really quietly || didnt || he
he didnt useta peep || his whistle

and || boosho
he couldnt stop || in || time
and || he || hit || the trailer
everybodys suitcases || burst || open didnt || they
and everything || fell || out
and somebody || must have had || some jam
in || the suitcase
because || he || had || jam || dripping || down || him
and || the fat controllers || suitcase || burst || open
and || the fat controllers trousers || flew || in || the air
and || wrapped || themselves
well
no
he || wasnt
no
because || they || were || in || his suitcase || at || the time
it || was || a suitcase || the train || hit
didnt || hit || the fat controller
it || hit || his luggage
and || suddenly || the fat controllers trousers
from || his suitcase
got wrapped round || the funnel || of || the train
and || then || he || realizes || that
0
he || wished || he || didnt || have || something || on || his funnel
because || he || felt || really silly
the passengers || were || furious

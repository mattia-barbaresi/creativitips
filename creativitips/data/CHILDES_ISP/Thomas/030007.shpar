ah
whats || that || boy || said || on || the platform
the boy || on || the platform
yesterday
yeah
he || said || there werent || any trains || running || didnt || he
yeah
something || on || the railway line
well || I || think || what || he || said
we || went || along || yesterday didnt || we
to have || a look || see || if || there || were || any trains || at || the station
and || the boy || shouted || across || to say || there || arent || any trains || today
theyre || running
and || he didnt || tell || us || why
he || just || said || that || on || Saturday || they || had been told || the trains
what || that || knocking
I || think || its Uncle Brain || doing || some work
oh look
theres || a man || walking || two doggys
he || just || said || there wouldnt || be || any trains || running || along
but || then || the boy || also || said || there || had been || a problem || with || some
something || had happened || to || some birds || the RSPCA || were coming
look || at || those doggys
wow
but || then || when || we || walked
wheres || the
when || we || walked || under || the railway bridge || some children || had been
and || they || had been throwing || lots || of || stones || down || over || the bridge
what || for
well || because || they || were || very very || naughty boys
thats || why
mhm
policeman || take || em || away
well || I || think || he || would || if || he || had seen || them
thats || very
the policeman || on || that railway
oh || well || we || didnt || see || a policeman
but || railways || usually || do have || railway police dont || they
transport police
but || you || see || Thomas its very very silly || to play || on
two reasons
one || is || that || those boys || playing || on || the track
even || though || they || thought || there werent || any trains || coming || along
and || then || what wouldve || happened
train || run || over || that belly and crash || in || their belly
their bellys
tummys
I || dont || like || the word belly
I dont || like || that || at all
0
yes
the train || would have run || them || over || wouldnt || it
but || the other thing || is || if || theyre || throwing || stones || on || the track
yeah
then || when || the train || comes || along || its not || going to be || able || to work
no
and || the wheels || will get stuck
and || then || its endangering everybody
all the passengers || sitting || on || the train
yeah
so || its a
on || nee naso
oh
and || thats || the other thing || we || saw
we || seem to see || fire engines || every time || we || go || out
do || you || remember || yesterday || that || fire engine
yeah
nee naso || ladders

well || whos || going to eat || that plate || of || food
uh Gingells
Gingells
yes
how || many times || do || you || think || you || can be || nice || to || Purdie || in || a day
I || think || if || you || were || nice || to || her || when || you || got || out || of || bed
because || you || always || say || “ good morning ” || to || Purdie dont || you
yeah
Purdie 0does
no
she doesnt talk || to || you
but || she || sometimes || runs || away || because || you || upset || her
if || you || were || nice || to || Purdie || when || you || got || up
and || then || if || when || she || came || downstairs || for || breakfast || you || left || her
and || then || when || she || waited || at || the door || to go || out || instead of || squealing
and || the same || with || every mealtime
lunch and evening meal
if || you || just || leave || her || alone || let || her || eat || her meals
es open your food
I || think || before || very long || a lot || of || stars || on
there Ive || got || six different colors
and || perhaps || theres || a silver one there
is || that silver
no
0it || is || purple
thats purple
thats silver
one two three four five six seven eight
now how || many times || do || we || think || we || can be || nice || to || Purdie
we || can be || nice || to || Purdie || when || we || get || up
when || shes having || her breakfast
when || shes || waiting || by || the door
when || shes having || her lunch || her evening meal
when || shes || sitting || by || the fire
yeah
thats || six times
and || then || what else || we || be || nice || to || Purdie
na buy || some things 0for Purdie
buy || something || for || Purdie
some sweets
some sweets
I dont || think || Purdie || really || eats || sweets
but || I || think || if || you || can be || nice || to || Purdie || every time || we || get
ap mash potato
mash potato
mashed potato
youre pretending || now || that || youre || in || Bodger and Badger arent || you
then || when || youve || been || nice || to || Purdie
Bodger
all those times
and || Badger
do || you || think || you || deserve || a little treat
yeah
just || like || were going to get || Purdie || a treat
mhm
Purdie || like || sausage
so youve || got || to get || at least seven stars

you dont || put || the biscuits || on || the floor Thomas
Purdie || like || stars
but || these || are || for || you
Purdie || will be watching || this every day
Purdie || will watch || this || to see || how many stars || youre getting
and || if || youre || nice || to || her || well || hafta || take || one || of || these stars
yeah
and || when || Daddy || comes || home || from || work
I || think || Daddy || might have || a look || at || the chart || to see || how many stars
yeah
now || youve been || very good || to || these three pussy cats || havent || you
and || are || you || going to be || nice || to || Purdie
yes
no
oh || well
you || wont get || what || Ive || got || for || you || now || then

I || was going to just give || you || a sweet || for || being || nice || to || these three
but || if || you || had said || you || were going to be || nice || to || Purdie || I || had
have || a sweet || now
ap good to all these toys
youve || been || very good || with || all these toys
why || dont || we || pick || the biscuits || up

no no not || now
well well || put || them || into || the bowl || for || these pussy cats
well || pick || them || off || the table
and || then well || go and have || a look || at || what weve || got
I || think || I || can give || you || it || for || being || a good boy
yeah
but || listen darling
when || we || have || these stars
and || for || being || a good boy
mhm
you || might get || a sweet
and || we || might do || something || that || youve || been wanting to do
it || wont be || the same treat || everyday
no
if || youve || been || a good boy || one day || you || might get || a jelly baby
get || a jelly belly || now
if || you
well || yes
if || youve || been || a good boy || another day || I || might read || you || a story
or || we || might go || for || a walk || somewhere where || youve || wanted to go
or || I || might let || you || do || something || you || dont || normally || do

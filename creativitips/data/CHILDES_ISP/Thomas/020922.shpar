now || what Im || trying to tell || you || Thomas
mhm
it doesnt || actually || show
oh yes || it || does
there || we || are
thats || the front hall || the stairs || the landing
mhm

and || the picture || they || have || on || the wall || is || a picture || of || a bowl || of
thats beautiful isnt || it
no the pen
just || a minute
0
so || all these rooms || are || downstairs
but || if || you || walk || up || the stairs || you || come || on || to || the landing
and || thats || where || you || find || the bedroom
theres || a tv room
the boys || bedroom || the bathroom
now
bowl ap carrots
a bowl || of || carrots
thats || the house roof
thats || the roof || on || the house
mhm
and || you || see || this strip || here

yes
look || up || there
what || you || see || up || there Thomas
is || that || the ceiling
yeah
well || on || this picture
look
0
this || is || the ceiling
no
youre || drawing || on || this box
yes
look
the ceiling || there
look
do || you || know || what || the ceiling || is || also
its the floor || of || these rooms || upstairs
so || this || is || the floor || down || here
mhm
if || you || look || at || the ceiling || up || there || in || our house || above || the
no
so || this ceiling || is || the bedroom floor
so || you || see || what || happens || Thomas
if || youre || in || the bathroom || here
here
and || you || drop || water
look
like || this bunny rabbit || here || still || in || the bathroom
if || you || drop || water || on || the bathroom floor
yeah
it || trickles
trickles
through || the ceiling
yeah
and || downstairs
yeah
so || you || imagine || if || Daddys || sitting || in || that chair || reading || his
mhm
and || were || upstairs || at || night || having || a bath
mhm
you || start splashing || water 0 || everywhere
yeah
it || might run || through || the bathroom floor || through || the ceiling
and || if || it || starts pouring || down || when || Daddys || sitting || in || that chair
is || it || going to land || on || top || of || him
yes
oh no
youre not sposta laugh
Daddy || would be || very very cross wouldnt || he
ap || fall || down || Daddys head
it || would fall || on || Daddys head
yeah
and || get || his newspaper || wet
ap || get || him || dry
and || then || wed || hafta || get || him || dry
oh I || bet || he || would shout
uh ap Daddy || very || cross
Daddy || would be || very cross wouldnt || he
Daddy || get || dry there || please
Daddy || get || dry please
yeah
but || the trouble || is || Thomas
apart || from || Daddy || getting || wet || his newspaper || getting || wet and
no
can || you || see || the paint || on || the ceiling
its white isnt || it
yeah
all that paint || would start coming || off
yeah
then || wed || hafta || get || the decorater || in || to paint || the ceiling
yeah
up || on || the ladder
yes
hed || need || ladders
and || a hammer
well || he || might not need || a hammer
no
probably just || a paint brush || a pot || of || paint
but || that || would cost || a lot || of || pennys
cost lots || of || blue pennys
lots || of || blue pennys
yes
probably || lots || of || twenty pound notes
or || whatever color || they || are || these days
green penny
ap blue penny
a green penny
a yellow one
ap || red || one
it || would cost || all sorts || of || colored money wouldnt || it
and || Daddy || would be || even crosser
yeah
and || when || Thomas || wanted || something || like || an ice cream || a little
wed || say “ cant || afford || it || Thomas ”
we hafta || pay || the decorater || to paint || the ceiling || because || you || tipped
yeah
so really
it || has been nice looking || at || this book || because
yes
bunny rabbit || splashes || water itll || run || downstairs || oh
it || will damage || the paint
damage || the carrot
it || would
it || would run || down || the walls || the picture || of || carrots || on || the bunny

about || the same size || as || the train

and || the houses || are || much smaller || than || the train arent || they
mhm
perhaps || the houses || are set || quite a way || back || from || the railway line
and || things || always || look || smaller || when || theyre || far away
so perhaps || the people || sitting || on || the train
when || they || look || at || the houses || in || the distance || thats || the size
are || you || still || tired sweetheart

village
Mummy || grew || up || in || a village
village Mummy || do || it
theres || the church

oh || fallen || over
no
they || hadnt fallen || over
until || you || tipped || them || up

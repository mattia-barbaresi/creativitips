because || I || couldnt come || in || last night
because || you || were || asleep || Daddy || was || asleep
if || Id || started putting || clothes || away || in || drawers
it || would have woken || you || up
so || we dont || want || any spills || this morning
because || I || havent had || a chance || to move || it
I || wouldnt be || very happy || if || I || hadta rewash || your
in || fact || do || you || know || why || I hadta || put || the washing machine || on || this

weve || got || some washing || to || peg || out || on || the line || later
because in || the washing machine
Ive || got || some things || in || that || are || in || a its called prewash
when || when || things || are || very dirty
sometimes || you || put || them || in || the washing machine
for || whats || called || the prewash
with || a little bit || of || powder
and || it || gives || them || a quick wash
and || then || lets || them || stand || in || water || to soak
to soak || stains || away
and || then || when || I || drain || that water
Ill || put || them || in || on || a proper wash

you || ran || outside || in || the wet
and || your socks || got || muddy
you || slipped || on || the grass
so || your trousers || were || dirty
but || then || I didnt || tell || you || this
last night || after || Id || done || my ironing
because || Daddy || had put || a couple || of || things || on || the video recorder
that || I || wanted to watch
so || when || you || went || to || bed || last night
I || stood || I || ironed || all these clothes
and || then || when || I || finished ironing
I || went || up || stairs
had || a quick shower
got || into || my night dress
came || down
put || the second video || on
well || the second program || I || wanted to watch
sat || down || with || a cup || of || coffee || to relax
and || guess || what || I || did
hm || what
dropped || the coffee
it || went || all || in || the chair
and || all || over || my nightie
so || I || ended || up || going || back || to have || a quick shower || again
and || putting || a clean night dress || on
and || then || cleaning || the chair
and || guess || where || the night dress || is
where
soaking || with || all your dirty things || in || the washing machine
laughs
I || think || youll || get || me || even dirtier

I dont || think || you || will
so || its a good job || really
because || that prewash
dont go || to || church || again
Ill || make || a more mess
no
you || wont
no
it || was || a pen || actually || from || church wasnt || it
yeah
that || you || got
I || think || that || you || just suddenly appeared || with || three biros
in || your pocket
whose pens || were || they
who || have || you || been pinching || pens || from
Im not || pinching || them
theyre || on || the floor
hm
seems || a bit careless
that || somebodys || left || three biros || on || the floor
mhm
two pens || one biro
two pens || one biro
well || a biro || is || a pen
biro || a blue one
the blue one hm
well || yes
I || noticed || your shirt || had || both black and blue marks || on || it
no
I || told || you || to get || pen || on || your clothes Thomas
um a that || you || wondered || what
the blue ones || were
well || I || knew || it || was || all biro or pen
but || no
that || was || your best shirt || yesterday Thomas
and || youve only || worn || it || once || before || yesterday
so || I || hope || the marks || come || out
oh
because if || they || do
clean || the toys
no
theres no try || clean || them || Tom
if || they dont || come || out || thats || it
and || when || you || next || needta be || smart || somewhere
youll hafta || go || in || a shirt || with || biro || all over

0

hm
I || hope || I || dont || find || theres || more biros || in || the pockets
I || hope || we || dont find || that
mind || you Daddy || sometimes || puts || biros || in || his shirt pockets
and || he || he || gets || little bit || of || biro || on || his shirt
mucky || us
mucky || you
yes dirty bertieswp
I || havent seen || Purdie || covered || in || biro || I || never || wanna
dont || ever || try and draw || on || Purdie || will || you
yeah
no
shes || brushed || up || against || paint || before
you || know || when || paints || wet
mhm
youve || seen || people || put || up || “ || caution || wet paint ” signs
or || they || just || say || “ wet paint || do not touch || ”
yes
Purdie cant || read
uhoh
Ive || forgotten || where || it || was || from
because || I || think wed been doing || some painting
not || here
when || the place || that || we || lived || at || before here
I || think || we || were really worried || about || Purdie
what
but nothing || happened || to || her
then || one || of || the neighbors || must have been doing || some painting
Purdie || walked || past || came || in || with || paint all down her side
was || it || funny
well || really || because
mhm Purdie
hm || well
luckily || with || her || being || a long haired cat
I || cut || it || off
good
ow my bottys || too sore
my bottys || too sore
whys your || botty sore
just || because || Ive || been sitting || down || all day
youve not || been sitting || down || a long time
youve || just || sat || down
itll || be || the way youre || sitting
you || mean || its stiff
ow
or || it || just || stuck || to || the chair
because || that || be || painful cant || it
mhm
when || you || stick || to || the chair
well || no
the the problem || is || with || pussy cat
she || can cats clean || themselves
lick
yeah
uh yucky poo
so if || youre || covered || in || paint
and || you || lick || it || off
whats || going to happen
the paints || going to go || in || your mouth
uh
and || paint || is || poisonous
so || I || hadta stop || her || licking || it || off
a lot || of || paint doesnt || just || wash || off
although || actually || I || think || this || did
so || what || I || did
we || held || her || down
got || scissors and cut || off || as much || as || we || could
and || then || we || bathed || her
which || she || didnt || like
0
but || at least || it || stopped || her || from || licking || the paint
I || think || if || a cats || very very badly || covered || in || paint
you || know || if || say || a paint pot || falls || on || their head or something
laughs
I || think || you || hafta || go || to || the vets || really
to get || them || sorted || out
unless || its a paint || that || you || can just wash || off || in || the shower
it || goes || owo meow
but cats dont || like || water
the trouble || is || because || Purdies || old
if || we hadta || give || her || a bath || now
mhm
mhm
shed probably get || very upset
and || that || in || itself || might make || her || poorly
bathing puss cats || thats || okay
well || no
its okay || to || bath || them
but || they || absolutely hate || it
I || have bathed || her || on || several occasions
hm
sometimes || when || shes || come || in || very very dirty
the thing || is || now
hm
poo
Thomas
stop || it
0
no
shes || I || know || shes || elderly or olderlyc
what || do || you || say
olderlyc
well || thats || a word
elderly || is || a word
and || old || is || the word
olderlyc
no
well || olderlyq || is || your your own little word
but || its quite cute
olderlyc
um no
Purdie doesnt || explore || quite as much || now || does || she
no
why || she || chase mice || anymore
oh Im sure || she || still || chases || mice
I || think || she || would
but || the only thing || is || we havent || got || mice || round || here
thank || goodness
although || again || Im sure || we || we || have || mice
we || have
because || Ive || seen || one || in || the sweet peas || last year
definitely || saw || a mouse
in || fact weve || had || one || since || then
but || what || I || mean || is
I || havent actually seen || Purdie || with || a mouse
when || you || were || a baby
mhm
one day Purdie || had || a mouse
out || just || outside || of || this door
0
and || I || remember || you || were || in || your little rocker top thing
and || I || picked || you || up || put || you || on || the table
and || then || I || stood || on || the table
then || I || rang || Linda || next door
and || I || said || “ oh Purdies || got || a mouse ”
and || she || said || “ well I cant || help || you ”
and || Linda || I || were talking || to || each other
through || the patio door
because || the conservatory wasnt || built || in || those days
we || were talking || to || each other || through || the patio door
and || we || were watching || Purdie || with || this mouse
and || eventually
mhm
I || managed to grab || hold || of || Purdie
so that || the mouse || had || time || to run || away || from || her
but || its not as
raaho
oh Purdie wasnt || happy || with || me
but || the thing || is || I || dont || like || mice
but || it || was || a little field mouse
it wasnt || as || if || it || was || in || the house
and || Purdies || a hungry animal
and || the reason animals || kill || other animals || is || for || food
to eat || them
you || know || cats || kill || mice || to eat || them
but || Purdie || has || loads || of || food
she doesnt needta || kill || a mouse || to eat || it
no
and || its || fair
poor little mouse
imagine || how || frightened || it || must have been
while || she || was tossing || it || in || the air
and || play || she || was having || fun
it || was || like || Tom and Jerry
she || thought || it || was || great
chasing || this poor little thing
so || I || held || onto || her
while || the mouse || ran || away
and || do || you || know || what || else || shes had
what
well || shes || had || birds
Ive || seen || her || with || birds
hm
and || frogs
weve || got || frogs || in || our garden
have || you || seen || them
you || know || where || they || are
near || your sand pit
oh || yes

and || we || collected || a pot || of || stones and pebbles
and || oh || you || were || very very young
but || you || useta || like || sitting || on || the floor
just || messing || about || with || these pebbles || outside
and || then || of || course || the Summer || went
and || the pebbles || were || outside || in || a plastic container
and || I || think || it || rained || it || rained || in || them
and || I || looked || at || the container || thought || it || was || all dirty water
I || thought || “ || oh || well || Ill || clean || it || up || one day ”
we dont || need || them || now
the next time || I || looked || we || had || a little family || of || frogs
that || had || sort || of || made || a home || in || this box
with || the water || the pebbles
so || we || left || it || thats || where || they || are
and || the box || is || still || there

moving || the arm || around
mhm
0
first time || I || saw || one || of || those
mhm
was || when || I || lived || in || Birmingham || there || was || this very
oh
and || I || was || on || something || like || the eleventh floor || my bedroom
I useta || watch || him || in || the morning
hed || arrive || on || the building site
hed || have || his hard hat || on || hed get || on || the outside || of || the ladder
Id || always || be || so frightened || because || sometimes || in || rainy windy days
yeah
when || he || was walking || on || the ladder || on || the outside
yeah
of || his crane || the whole crane || would be shaking || one day somebody
yeah
I didnt || see || it || happen || one || of || them || fell || right || down || the middle
I || dont || know || whether || he || was hurt
I || presume || he || was hurt
I dont || know || anything || about || it || um || I useta || think || it || was
mhm
imagine || that || crane driver
mhm
would be || able || to look || from || his box || see || the entire city
no
but || he || fell || down
well || lo || yes
I || mean || one || of || them || fell || down
Im sure there || was || more than one
I dont || mean || more than one || fell || down
Im sure theres || more than || one crane driver || thats || what
oh
look
the ship || is || a crane
yes
the mans || sitting || right || at || the top || of || what || is || normally || our train
mhm
driving || a crane
beepo
brro
but || they || use || those cranes || an awful lot || now || to put || up || modern
mhm
we || watched || it || when || we || watched || the flats || being built
in || Didsbury
mhm
you || remember || that
Im || building || a crane
youre || making || a crane || now
with || all || s || little bricks
oops
youve || really || got || into || lego havent || you
you || like || playing || with || lego
look
Im || using
this || is || the crane
could || you || possibly just || pass || me || that || please || Thomas
its a very smart crane isnt || it
look || at || that
oh yeah
mmmo
Mum
yeah
what || was || off || his ladder
I || dont know
I didnt || see || it || happen || I || think || he || was || either
he || was taken || away || in || an ambulance
wonder || how || he || was || how high || was || he
dont || know
I didnt || see || it || happen
I || dont || know || whether || he || was || a little way || up || the ladder
I dont || know || how high
I wasnt || there || I || really || cant || remember || now
Mum
look
um || when || you || were looking || at || 0the crane
did || it || have did || it || just || have || ladders
just up || straight
or || curly ladders
no
it || had || straight ladders
but || I || say || ladders || it || wasnt || actually || ladders
but || if || you || look || at || those cranes
mhm
look || at || the
because || the the bit || on || the ground
is || sort || of || like || a truck isnt || it
but || its the || goes || up
mhm
is || actually || like || scaffolding
and || thats || where || they || useta || walk walk
but || I || think || he useta || walk || inside
there || must have been || something || inside || for || him || to hold || onto || because
its got || this huge arm || on || the crane || that || was || where || his controls
he useta || have || a little sack || with || him || to go || up || there
did || he || drop || his sack || when || he || was falling
well
presumably || the man || going || up || that day || had || sandwiches
I didnt || see || him || fall || Thomas
I || dont know
what Ill || do || when || Im || next || talking || to || somebody
mhm
who || was || there || at || the time
Ill || ask || them || if || they || remember || the day || the man || fell || off || his crane
might
n n n || no
they wouldnt || have || pictures || because || they || wouldnt || have || a camera
he || just || fell
the funny thing || was || we || were watching || a program || on
the television || one night

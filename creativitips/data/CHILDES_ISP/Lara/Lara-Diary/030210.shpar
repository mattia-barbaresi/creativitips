why || are || you || standing || up
why || is || the door || closed
what || is || it
where || is || Amy
what || is || this || for
what || I || do
how || I || get || down
where || is || my biscuit
where || is || the pig
how || you || do || this
how || you || do || this
which one || do || you || want
where || has || the other one || gone
where || is || it
where || is || that || one || gone
where || is || our list
where || you || are
how || you || do || Amys
how || you || do || these
what || is || Snow White || doing
where || is || the vomit

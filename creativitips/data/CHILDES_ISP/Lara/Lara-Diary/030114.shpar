whose || am || I || siting || on || foot
who || is || that leg
where || has || dad || gone
where || has || giraffe || gone
where || has || the giraffe || gone
why || are || you || not going to take || me || to || nursery
why || were || you || washing || up
where || teddy || go
what || you || do
why || you || shut || the window
what || you || do
where || this one || go
what || have || you || forgot
what || is || she
why || has || daddy || gone || in || there
why || is || he || holding || his foot
why || is || he || downstairs
what || you || do
why || you || shut || the window
what || you || do
where || this one || go
what || have || you || forgot
what || is || she
why || has || daddy || gone || in || there
why || is || he || holding || his foot
why || is || he || downstairs
where || teddy || go

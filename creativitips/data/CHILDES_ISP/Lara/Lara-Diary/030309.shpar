what || is || that dirt
where || 0has daddy || gone
what || is || that || from
why || didnt || you || have || your hood || on
what || are || you || called
where || has || the cat || gone
why || are || you || clearing || up || the floor
what || have || you || got || in || your mouth
who || has come to see || me || now
where || is || the end
where || is || bob

why || are || those holes || on || a stalk
what || are || they
why || are || those colors
where || has || the hoover || gone
where || is || teletubbies || gone
what || is || that || funny noise
what color blue
what || is breathing
which one || is || they || called
what || is || the matter
where || has || the soap || gone
where || has || More Dadaw || gone
why || dont || I || have || a biscuit || that || we || made
what || is || the matter
who || is || first

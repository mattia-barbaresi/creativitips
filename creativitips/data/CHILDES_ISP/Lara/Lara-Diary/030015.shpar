why || has || the light || gone
what || is || that
where || has || the other people || gone
why || you || get || out
who || has got || the balloon
where || has || the car || gone
where || has || Daddy || gone
where || is || Abis bobble things
why || is || the bee || not going to go || outside
why || has || the lights || gone
why || the man || come
where || has || my strap || for || my hair || gone
where || you || going
where || you || sleeping
where || are || you || going to go
what || is || that
who || did take || this lid || off
what || is || that
what || for
what || is || in || here
what || is || in || there

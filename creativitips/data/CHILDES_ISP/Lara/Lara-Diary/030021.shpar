where || has || daddy || gone
why || you || doing || that
where || has || Elsie Grandma || gone
when || Georgie || Abi || coming
when || Georgie and Abi || not coming to playgroup
what 0are || they || doing
what 0are || they || doing
what || is || all that smoke || there
what || is || all that smoke
where || you || put || your glasses
what 0are || you || feeding || her || inside || for
where || 0is daddy || phoning
what 0are || you || doing
why || 0have || you || got || pen || in || your ear
who || is || behind || me
why || you || put || this up || here

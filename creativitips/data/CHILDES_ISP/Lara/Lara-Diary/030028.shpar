where || has || the bottom || gone || from || this lid
how || you || do || it
how || you || do || that bit
why || is || water || in || there
why || dont || you || just || pour || them || in
why || you || writing || something || down
where || has || daddy || gone
where || has || he || gone
what || is || that
what 0are || you || doing
why || 0are || you || rubbing || your eyes
what || have || you || done
where || has || your wellys || gone

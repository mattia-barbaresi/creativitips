where || have || they || gone
where || have || the shoes || gone
what || is || called
what || are || you || going to do
what || are || you || three || doing || over || there
what || are || you || doing
what || is || this || for || this hole
what || did || Daddy || hurt || himself || on
what || we || do
where || has || the other marble || gone
who || eats || this
what || you || do
what || you || do

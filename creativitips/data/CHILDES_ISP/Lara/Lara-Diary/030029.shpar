what || have || you || got || in || your mouth
what || have || you || got || in || your hand
why || is || mummy || driving
which way || do || we || go
what || did || Amy || do
why || are || you || looking || in || that book
what || is || she || having
why || you || hafta || ride || on || little ponys
why || dont || they || come || out
how || you || do || this
why || are || we || going || home
why || is || it || a bumpy road
what || is || all that mud

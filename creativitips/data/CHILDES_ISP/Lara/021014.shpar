once || there || were || ten dalmatian puppies
Pongo || was || their father
Perdy || was || their mother
they all || lived || in || a house || in || the city || with || two very nice people
one day || the puppies || went || for || a walk
a woman || named || Cruella || was going || by || in || her car
Cruella || was || a dog thief
as soon || as || she || saw || the puppies || she || stopped to count || them
ten
she || cried
ten dalmatian puppies
I || must have || them
oh
shes naughty
shes || going to steal || the puppies
two men || worked || for || Cruella
their names || were || Horris and Jasper
Horris || was || short fat and dumb
Jasper || was || tall thin and dumb
I || want || those puppies
she || told || them
get || them || tonight
then || that night Japer || Horris || sneaked || into || the house || where || the
everyone || was || asleep
they || put || the puppies || in || a big black bag || then || they || climbed || out || the
the puppies || began || to || bark || inside || the bag
Pongo and Perdy || were woke || up
their basket || was || empty
the puppies || were gone
where || are || the puppies
cried || Perdy
I || dont know
said || Pongo
oh || look || look
the baskets || empty || now
the puppies || are gone
where
them naughty mens || pinched || them
Horris || Jasper
then || Pongo || had || an idea
well || send || a message || to || all the dogs || in || the city
maybe || someone || has seen || our puppies
so || Pongo || sent || a message
the message || went || from || dog || to || dog
a yip || a yelp
dalmatian puppies || need || your help
a bark || a woof || a long bow wow
find || our puppies
find || them || now
soon || all the dogs || in || the city || were barking
look
all the dogs || are barking
bet || thats noisy isnt || it
when || all the dogs || are barking
in || an old barn || near || the city || there || lived || a horse || named || Captain
a dog || named || Colonel
and || a cat named Seargent Tibs
that night || they || heard barking
it || was coming || from || the city
its a message
said || the Colonel
someone || is looking || for || dalmatian puppies
non || here || sir
said || Tibs
coming || from || the house || down || the road
sounds || like || puppies
said || Colonel
I || believe || youre || right
said || Tibs
then || we || must go || see || if || they || are || dalmatian puppies
said || the Colonel
why || we || hafta do || that
asked || the Captain
because of || the message
said || Tibs
they || marched || down || the road || up || to || the old house
the barking || got || louder and louder
how
said || the Colonel
there || is || a light || in || one window
why || is || that || so odd
said || the Captain
because || no one lives || here
said || Tibs
they || went || to || the window || peaked || in
the room || was || full
filled || with || dalmatian puppies
look || at || that
look || Lara
look || at || all them puppies
hundreds || of || them || isnt || there
are || they || going to come || in
yes
theyre all || in || there
a man || was holding || a big black bag
it || was filled || with || ten more dalmatian puppies
a woman || in || a fur coat || was saying
now || I || have || ninety nine dalmatian puppies
tomorrow I || will sell || all || of || them || to || the circus || the three || of
the three animals || raced || back || to || the barn
then || the Colonel || sent || a message
calling || all dogs
every mutt and hound
the dalmatian puppies || have been found
a yip || a yelp || a short bow wow
come and save || them
come || right now
soon || the city dogs || were barking || again
it || wont || work

give || me || a hold || of || it || a minute
there || so
it wont work || if || you || keep || it || like || that

right
turn || the page || over || again
at || last the message || came || to || Pongo and Perdy
the puppies || have been found
cried || Pongo
we || must go and save || them
and || they || jumped || out || of || the window
Pongo and Perdy || ran || through || the city
the city dogs || met || them || along || the way
they || told || Pongo || Perdy || how || to get || to || the old barn
oops
youve || dropped || your pen
oops
when || the Colonel || saw || them || coming
he || called
are || you || looking || for || the dalmatian puppies
yes
they || called || back
no
are || you gonna || sit || over || here || finish || the story
they
they || are || in || the old house || down || the road
so || Pongo and Perdy || followed || the Colonel || the Captain and
Pongo and Perdy || went || into || the old house
they || saw || two men || with || their puppies
the two men || saw || them
well || look || whos || here
said || Jasper

Pongo || growled and leaped || at || Jasper

the Tale || of || Mrs Tiggywinkle
once || upon || a time || there || was || a girl || called || Lucy
who || was always losing || her pocket handkerchiefs
she || said || + " /
have || you || seen || them || Tammy Kitte
the kitten || went || on || washing || her white paws || so || she || asked || a speckled
have || you || seen || them
but || the speckled hen || went || into || a barn || clucking || + " /
and || then || she || asked || Cock Robin || sitting || on || a twig
Cock Robin || looked || sideways || at || Lucy || with
cant
she || climbed || up || the style || looked || up || the hill
cant
yes || Lara
just || listen || to || the story
then || up || the hillside || she || thought || she || saw || something white spread
scrambled || up || the hill
up || up || up || up
cant || go || on || there
then || she || came || to || a spring
and || looked and saw || a tin || on || the water
but || it || was || so little || the water || was already running || over
and || where || the sand || was || wet || there || were || little foot marks || of || a very
Lucy || ran || on and on
the path || ended || under || a big rock
the grass || was || short and green
and || there || were || clothes
but || no pocket handkerchiefs
she || knocked || once twice || interrupted || a song
a little frightened voice || called || + " /
whos || that
and || what || do || you || think || was || under || the hill
a nice clean kitchen || with || a flag floor || wooden beams
just || like || any other farm kitchen
but || it || was || tiny
there || was || a nice hot
at || the table || with || an iron || in || her hand || stood || a very short stout
her pink gown || was tucked || up
she || was wearing || a large apron || over || her striped petticoat
her little black nose || went
and || her eyes || went twinkle || twinkle || and || underneath || her cap || where || Lucy

Im Mrs Tiggywinkle
Im an excellent clear starcher
and || she || put || something
whats || that
thats || a scarlet waistcoat || belonging || to || Cock Robin
this isnt || my pinny
said || Lucy +
thats || a damp tablecloth || that || they || used || at
and || this
her eyes || went || twinkle twinkle || as || she || fetched || another hot iron || from
theres || one || of || my pocket hankinsf || theres || my pinny
oh this || is || lovely
said || Lucy +

I || only || hafta || iron || them

those || are || the wooly coats || belonging || to || the little lambs

and || look || at || the sheep mark || on || the shoulder
theyre || always || marked || at || washing
and || she || hung || up || all sorts and sizes || of || clothes
one velvety black moleskin waistcoat
and || a very much shrunk blue jacket || belonging || to || Peter Rabbit
then || she || made || a cup || of || tea
she || was || very brown || and || in || the soap
and || there || were || hairpins || sticking || the wrong end || out || so that || Lucy
when || they || finished || tea || they || tied || up || the clothes || in || bundles
Lucys pocket handkerchiefs || were folded || up || inside || her clean pinny
no Amy
you || play || with || that || though || because || it || cant || do || you || any damage
then || they || made || up || the fire || with || turf
and || came || out || locked || the door
they || hid || the key || under || the door sill
Amy
get || off
and || away || they || trotted || little animals || came || out || of || the fern || to
out || of || the ferns || to meet || them || the first || to come
and || she || gave || them || their nice clean clothes
and || all the little animals and birds || very much || obliged
as || they || came || to || the bottom || of || the hill || there || was || nothing || left || to
Lucy || scrambled || up || the stile || said || good night
and || Mrs Tiggywinkle hadnt || waited || for || thanks || the washing bill
she || was running || up || the hill
and || where || was || her || white frilled cap || her shawl || her gown
and || how brown || covered || with || prickles

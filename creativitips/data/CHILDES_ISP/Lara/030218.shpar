she || said
how || I || would || like || a little daughter || with || skin || as || pure || as || the snow

when || a little girl || was born || thats || just || how || she || looked || so || she || was

that girl
that girl

called || Snow White

the new queen || was || very beautiful || very vain
and || she || would look || in || her magic mirror || ask
mirror mirror || on || the wall
who || is || the fairest || of || us || all
she || was || very pleased || when || the magic mirror || answered || thou oh queen
what || was || that

Snow White || is || the fairest || of || them || all
whos || that

she || told || the huntsman || to take || the little girl || into || the forest
the huntsman || was || a kind man || decided || to do || as || he || was ordered
he || took || Snow White || into || the forest || left || her || there
warning || her || to go || back || to || the palace
Snow White || was || very frightened || at || first || the animals || she || met
it || was growing || dusk || when || Snow White || came || to || a little cottage || among
perhaps || someone || will let || me || stay || the night || here
said || Snow White
it || looked || such a friendly little cottage
that || she || walked || boldly || up || the path || tapped || on || the door
no one || answered || so || Snow White || finding || the door || unlocked steeped
the cottage || inside || was || just as pretty || inside as || outside
Snow White || found || seven little chairs || drawn || up || to || the table
and || seven little beds || neatly arranged || in || a row
this cottage || must belong || to || seven very small people
thought || Snow White
perhaps || they || will be || kind || to || a little girl

then || she || took || a sip || of || milk || from || each mug

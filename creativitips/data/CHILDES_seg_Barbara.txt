well Katharine lives in Canada now funnily enough
but she was born over here
right
but shes another Barbara Barbara Alice
but from the very start we useta call Barbara you know
its not very adventurous
but both the grannys
original do you not think so
there shes called after her granny Sadie and her granny Alice
I think a lot of these names nowadays like Zoe and Kirsty you
wanted to call her Bianca
and I says
no question whatsoever
I says
no way
become so dated
do you not think theyll become terribly dated when theyre like in
thought of an old woman called Bianca
or going out and calling Bianca in front of
names like like Barbara like Barbara and Catherine and all
this is it
and they dont date
I dont think
though I must admit when Adam was born I think we just
and I thought
Adam that will do
well just call him Adam
but since he was born I think theres been a hundred of them
just a wee baby that has been born theyve called it Adam
will I go and get the coffee

yeah
a whole lot of toys havent you
what does she like
loves books
absolutely adores books
does she
thats good
shes a kitchen out there
to tell you the truth Barbara would have as much fun out of a
shes getting into dolls now babies and that
to tell you the truth Christmas Im not giving her an awful lot
because she has plenty
and really shes too much now
she doesnt know what to play with
shes getting interested in
whats that book like
you sit down and read it
thats a great one
thats got lots of good things in it
talk to Cathy one wee minute
go get a wee bowl out of your kitchen
and you can put them in
why
are you going to put them back into the bag
thats a good idea yeah
shes really playing with
as I say her wee dolls shes pretty interested in them
jigsaws now just the first ones nothing advanced
oh yes och of course
I mean shes still very young
shes playing with them quite a bit now
they go through wee phases I think
show you my kitchen until you see exactly what that child has
she has everything
storing the stuff its if youre like me
well Im not getting anything big this year
I know
Ive got her a high chair and a doll
you see and
tell me this Ruth do you have a pram for her
does she have a pram
that theres a pram there
but I
no I dont mean a pr
oh yes a dolls pram
what one did you buy
because Im looking to get one for Kathryn for Christmas and I
one I have
dont know what one to get
because some people have said to me
dont get
shes like Barbara
shes quite petite you know
Barbaras petite as well and small you know
shes a tiny wee thing
shes not
a lot of the ones I have looked at are awfully big looking
you know what I mean
did you look at the one at the Early Learning Centre
no thats about the only place I havent been
that was given to me
my cousin give me that
because I was going to get her a pram
but uh to tell you the truth that other get her for her
thats just what I was going to say
now you see a lot of
you know these bigger ones
these bigger ones to me
I think she would
pull over
I think shes too small for them
I anything she has is all the Early Learning Centre stuff
its
whats the one in it like
therere two
she has again
you see shes the youngest of all my cousins
Im getting everything
oh well thats great
passed up to me
because my mummie hands one up
I got her these too
what about that one
yeah thats a brilliant
theres a monkey on the front of it too
do you know who I think that is
is that Spot
no no its not
theres lots of wee pictures in that one
you can lift up the flaps
she has that wee one in the house up at my Mummys
that theres quite a good
and theyre not dolls like
is that just a wee bit bigger maybe than that one
Id say thats much the same or or less the same size as that
because you dont want anything too expensive for
plus theyre lightweight so they the
lions lions
thats right
lions
thats right
thats a lion
and whats that one
a clown
a clown
oh youre a clever girl
whats that one
yes its great now
wait until you see
look
its got a slide
its got lots of things that you can feel
whats that
well have a wee look in a wee minute
do you look read the book
well that thats a good idea
now I dont know where that ones from
Im going to go into town on Saturday
so Ill probably get one there
thats but you think thats suitable for them
its great for them
they all they do is
she whizzes round with it
and she pulls in to every
you know youre
I think with having a wee boy my house is full of train
did you buy an awful lot for your first one
och I did
whats that one like
not an awful awful lot
whats that one like
whats that one like
but whats that one like
thats all about trucks and diggers and things
you see weve got lots of those in our house
Ill be honest it was my mother bought an awful lot of stuff
aye well thats other people sort of buying you
but you get a lot of stuff and then by the time number two comes
I mean she is playing with train sets and
but you know you dont needta buy you know www
a friend of she has a wee girl a year older than Barbara
and she has a baby Allgo
she loves it
and they feed it
and the food goes onto its mouth
so I got her that and the high chair
and as I say the nurses uniform
thats basically it
youll be spoilt rotten by the time your grannys finished with you
told my mummie not this year
because shes far too much to tell you the truth
Im sure your mummie has her spoiled rotten
yes she tells me off for buying stuff
I know for buying with your
whats that like
whats that like
thats all about the wee teddy
wait until you see
look thats Teddy
whats that
hes got an umbrella
whats that
a caravan
a caravan its not a caravan
but imagine you saying that
isnt that great
who has a caravan
yes and a fire engine
whats that
a foal
shes great
she is so clear
what is that
what is that
she is
now as I say I was putting it down to
because my Mummy talks to her
whats that
whats that
whats that
whats that
but thats brilliant
this is a blessing from heaven getting this one
to kids coming
she is very clear
but as I say I was putting it down to
my mother and father in law they keep her in the afternoon
and she just chitters away there
och its not
och I know
but it wouldnt affect how articulate she is
it wouldnt affect her pronunciation you know
I mean shes shes very clear which is great
and it makes our job so much easier when youre listening through
Ive got a wee boy at the moment
at hes coming four
and I honestly think hes going to needta go to speech therapy
a word he says
and Ive been for four visits
and theres myself and another girl that work on this project
and we were listening to the tape the other day and
theres no point in using him
we just cant make out a thing he says
and what are you using this for
just for our own research
its a three year project based down at
were called the Department Of Communication
and were not related to the speech therapists or anything like
more the academic side of whats called linguistics the study of
and theres been lots of work done on childrens language
but there hasnt been any done in Northern Ireland on how children
were interested in Belfast English as well
but were just interested to know how children acquire the
so were looking at children between two when theyre sort of
shes actually really really good to have
because shes two years and four months
and shes at the age where shes really putting her words together
you know really getting her grammar going
www
well you see Peter he was married before me
and he has a wee girl from his first marriage
now Linda was very
but Linda turned out to be dyslexic so she did
right
but a bright wee article
shes just started at secondary school now
thats good
but I think it
I watch her
because I think thats what happened
she didnt discover it until Linda was eight or
so you just going to have a wee bit of everything
shes
I take this og a frog
is that a frog
yeah
and shes been talking from she was very young then
she wasnt very young
she just seemed to talk everything all at once
she didnt particularly baby talk
she just all
I want a wee drink of Coke
okay
come on I want a wee drink of coke
och shes marvelous
she really is
she just seemed to say everything all at once
shes got it all there
I want a wee drink of Coke
shes got full sentence you know what I mean
coming in and saying
thats ridiculous Mummy
and I just go
oh I dont know what this wee girls going to say
Keltie come on
out you come
come on
good girl out into the kitchen
did you get your Coke
its Daddys
its Daddys Coke
yes
oh right
and does Daddy allow you to drink it
Daddy let you have some
dont tell Daddy
dont tell Daddy you drunk his Coke
so she started then
what sort of stage would you say
what age would she have been when she sort of started using one
nine ten months maybe
but by a year like I mean she was putting sentences together and
just over a year maybe
didnt walk very quick
she wasnt a quick walker
but again once she
Im hopeless at at times
I am trying to think
I know its difficult to remember sometimes isnt it
but shes certainly very well developed now
yummy yummy yum eh
look at all these teddies
are these teddies yours
Im trying to think
when I got her the Snow White must have been her second
so she would have been about a year and six months
and within two months of that she could sing the songs out of it
having said that that was because I was watching it maybe
and she would still watch it
but now the Tots Tv and Rosie And Jim
Tots Tv she really does love it
yeah yeah its its a great wee thing for them
theyre they love those sort of animated
I think its because theyre theyre short clips
they dont hafta sit and keep on concentrating for
she you couldnt keep her
every single bit
drink it all up
drink it all up
yes
great
shes got this jasdeu from
there was a of my mother and
she started saying jasdeu

www
but thats just sheer
aye
nosiness
uhhuh
oh
but I
oh
I useta be like that apparently
oh
my mummie said every house I went into first thing I said was
can I go to the bathroom
this thing about toilets
hm shes not doing too badly
I know
like the way she hasta
I dont mean shes been perfect by any means
this last couple of days she done enough very well
my mum took her down to toddlers yesterday
aye
and she put the pants on her
thats very good
because I
yeah aye
but my mummie says
why cant
when I brought I just sent her up with her pajamas on
can I cut your
uhhuh
uhhuh
and then your mummie
she says she took her nappie off and charged straight to the toilet
come here
and is it the toilet or the pottie
both
whatever but mostly the toilet
shell go to the toilet on her own and all
is it not
how do you know
all were going to hear today is your daddy drilling
I know
well thats very good
so Id been sticking her in a pair of the training pants out of
and Ill give you a piece of advice
see when you start get the ones out of Boots
theyre half the price
and theyre the best ones youd get anywhere
so they are
have they got like toweling in them or something
no
they are
get Cathy a pair of your pants out of your box
the baby pants now not the big girl pants
I am dreading it
it was laziness on my part too
oh yes
theyre far far better now than the
now I tried the Pampers and all
and she wet right through to her
and I dumped them
are they like wearing a nappie for them
I suppose it is
like would she take them down
yes
and then pull them up again
yes
but shes got other pants
shes got her big girl pants
but those are great then for the first couple of weeks then
sure
Ive had her in them six months now
good
are they the same price Ruth as
I suppose you wouldnt get as many
theres sixteen in that
and theyre three pound odds
three pound odds it is
well thats
in the Pampers you get thirty two or sixteen
and its odds
and theyre not as good
theyre really not as good
are they Boots own then
Boots own make
Ill know what to do now
I must get those anyhow
I tried Kathryn
Ive taken out her pottie
but shes not really interested
well I have tried from last summer
she likes the idea
but shes not really interested
on and off
but it was always the same
you put that back
okay
but the Pampers
and theres another one make them Huggies
she was soaked right through you know
if I had her out she was soaked right through to her clothes
but theyre as good as nappies
theyre thick
uhhuh
thats good
now I swore by Pampers nappies
thats all I ever used on her but
mind you I changed to the Huggies
did you
I changed to the Huggies
I thought they were better for the
whoops
now starting with newborn Boots
I used the Boots
so Ill do that again
so I will
yeah
oh see when I sat down
you know the way you think this is what you want
and see when they told me I came home
and I was sitting and Peter says to me
daddy daddy go
have you still got all your stuff
yes
thats not too bad
I was sort of
Barbara
shes okay
I got the lend of a highchair
and Im so glad
I didnt cause
I gave an awful lot of that stuff away now
Ive been giving everything away
the only thing I would have is a stand
you know a stand for a Moses basket
or have you got a
Ive got the lend of a swinging cradle
lovely
and then I have the pram
thats it
I told you no ball in the house
I was just going to give it away
Ive been clearing out everything
I gave away my highchair and all
well I dont have a highchair
but if I dont get the lend of one
Im not buying one
because its not as if she used the highchair much
a girl out of work borrowed the wee car seat
you know the one with the handle on it
but she knows Im pregnant now
so shell give me it back again
I dont think Ive anything else really
I say Ive got that stand in the garage
but everything else is gone
I pushed my stuff away
Ive still got some wee baby clothes
but well wait and see what it is
Im sure youve loads of stuff from her anyway

and it cost her thirty pound
I didnt know you could do that
and the hairs off it

Kathryns doing that as well taking the nappie on and off
thats dirty
mummie you do it
tell her to shush and stop crying
now look at this you see
if you get a wee baby a real wee baby of your own youll be
there you go
thats round the wrong way
Ill not be able to turn my head
shell just go and pick it up like
shell not let you do anything
no Ill do it
I can just hear her
but itll progress like
because before she just said
well just send it up to my granny Sadie
shell just hafta learn
thats all you can do
look at your hair
Cathy says would you go up and do a wee bit of work in her house
theres dust everywhere
for goodness sake
Cathy has one of the houses up past the graveyard isnt it
uhhuh
she done it again
up where who lives
do you live in the first ones though or the second ones
the second ones
the ones closest to the next roundabout or the ones that has just
I live in the ones that are closer to the graveyard
right
thats the newer ones then
were in a year and a bit now
youve no staircases to sand down now
they didnt leave our staircases in a great state
we havent done our hall yet
just right
I dont want it
the hall and stairs is a big thing to do isnt it
yes
I wanna get a wooden floor down on the downstairs
do you know what there is out there
what
a parquet floor
and hes spilt paint over it and everything
why dont you sand it down and use it
I think theyre gorgeous
just in the hall there
he says its
plus what put him off was kids slipping up and down it
www
we talked about putting a conservatory on the back
youre lovely and bright here
you could do with one
Cathy what annoys me is doing all this work
see if we ever thought about moving we would never get our money
youve got a great site here
I mean look at your view
although I cant ever see us moving now
sure
what would you move for
well I would want a conservatory out the back
but it would mean ripping the whole kitchen out
would you hafta
well you see its the way the doors are
sure your kitchens lovely
and then it means the floor coming up and all
so I says
let me have a year at least
right
thats it
you dont play with the ball in the house
Ill smack you if you do it again
youll break one of my ornaments
I didnt hit one of your ornaments
youre a bad girl
youre showing Cathy your true colors now
oh I know what theyre like
dont worry
theres Adams a good boy
you must be joking
hes the cheekiest wee boy in the world at the moment
I think they all go through that stage but
I could gladly give him away sometimes
the girl I work with Lorraine theres a year between her and
and shes exactly the same
sometimes that wee girl doesnt know how to be bad enough
why do you think that is
I useta think that was children that didnt get any attention did
if anything I think is its because they get too much
some days I scream
when I was off there was one day I said to Peter
Ill swing for her I really will
oh watch your wee finger on that pet
to say the fl
she has
do you want me to say it
oh no you dont say that
its not a nice one
I dont know if shes saying it an awful lot
but shes saying it
before we ignored it
and then before Easter she said it
and I will tell you Cathy she did not hear it from me
I dont know where it comes from
but she doesnt hear it from me
I am no angel
but thats a thing I just never did use
oh youre disgraced arent you
www
she came off with worse than that Cathy
Ill tell you
I was sitting in my mummies on New Years Day
and she came in and says
and like my mummies a Christian like
and I nearly passed out
and my mummie says
what did you say there
and she said it again
and the sweat broke on me
and I says
mummie she doesnt hear that from me
I dont know where she got that from
and I still dont know to this day where she got that from
did that come off
Kilty the dog
and for all Peters faults thats not a thing he uses in front of
so I dont know where they pick half the things up
they do
youd be surprised
shes been told its a bad word and shes not allowed to use it
oh dear well time for me to go
why
because I hafta go and get my wee boy
I hafta go and get Adam from school
or hell be waiting for me

the batteries dont give you any warning
they just stop
they go on full power
and then they just stop

so you never know when to change them
that has never happened me before
theyre thirsty

and I got those wee pants that you told me about
uhhuh
and I tried them for a couple of days
and I know if it had been Adam it would have taken him
they would have been very good
but it would have taken him far longer
she came out of them in a couple of days
and I honestly I mean she had a wee accident every now and
uhhuh
but shes alright
but shes still soaking in the mornings
no well I went through
shes still got her in nappies
Peters father was taken into hospital
and then there was school
and they told me at school when they mentioned the toilet she was

now they said she was fine after it
I know
she called for her mummie and everything
and I says to her

because you fall down the toilet
and I says
youll not fall down the toilet
now she did have that fear and got over it

Kathryn does that too
no I done it in my pants
were you too late

she goes in
and she cant get them down in time
sometimes theyre only a wee bit wet
its not wet

www
she always has been any time the health visitors out
but not extremely over
yeah
but uh
yes you can color in if you run up

and thats why shes afraid
aye I know och I know
but sure I went through a week of sheer hell
I know you did
I went through seven months of it with Adam everyday
that was terrible
seven months
that was awful
thats why I said to you I was dreading it so much
I couldnt believe Kathryn came out so easy
you know it was like one extreme to the other
I couldnt believe it
I was taking her taking her to the Abbey centre and all
the thing was she could hold on you know
wee boys needta go the toilet

and they told her and uh it
but I thought that was awful funny
well
you know
I have a feeling
because its a bit of a different pregnancy that
but Ill be delighted if its a girl

because I love a wee girl
and I never had a sister
and I would love her to have a wee sister
yes I know
but Im afraid if she doesnt get it

I know Im
youre knackered
shell be alright
she will love it
she will
she will too she will
but its tough
its tough for them
and its very understandable
youre right it is
because its a real culture shock for them

what darling
why dont you do it the other way
because it was all done that one
because I wanna hear you talking
and I have told her shell hafta choose between our bedroom and her
because she cant have everything
so shell have like to sleep in a single bed on her own
or else Ill move her into the other room
because the baby needs the bedroom too
if you have your own bedroom
you can have all your toys in it and everything
and its great fun isnt it

whered you buy that Cathy
a friend made it for for Kathryn for Christmas

oh I know they look awful footery
I can put it to the other side
yes you just keep pulling it through
look like that and then pull
pull at one now
look youre going to end up on the floor
I learn how to do this
isnt it lovely Barbara
does your mummie knit
but she doesnt knit no more
does she not
shes too busy now
I do the other side again
I just thought she was lovely
and youd like to see her

uhhuh
but
well are there other ones you can do then

no its not
Alisons isnt the same as that now
uhhuh
I think thats the pattern I have
I dont even know where I have it
now now now wait until I get your dodo
I think weve had enough of playing with the jigsaw
what
I think weve had enough playing with it
and you want it
isnt she lovely
yeah
uhhuh
well do you know what I brought
I brought a couple of books to have a look at
do you wanna have a look at them
yeah
will you
which bag are they in
my goodness listen to that noise
yes and weve got some more dollies
have we got dollies in the bag as well
yeah look
if Ive dollies in my bag I must have them in me
oh I know what I have them for
that was for something else
but you could do that for me as well
that would be very good
well I tell you what
if you do this for me Ill read you Cinderella
how about that
would that do
alright
would you
I think I did this before with you when you were a wee a wee
you might look at those dollies
theyre all falling apart
and theyre filthy
theres Cinders
and theres one with this
theres one with this too
isnt it
wait until you hear this one
what
she could do with her hair combed couldnt she
look at that
yes
and her dress needs put in the washing machine doesnt she
yeah
I hadta buy a new washing machine last week
it gave up just like that
Vincent tried to fix it and tried this and that and the other
and before I knew it I had a new one
its a thing you cant do without Ruth
my Nilfisk washing machine or
vacuum cleaner
vacuum cleaner went on fire
och no
it made funny noises and then
Ive a Nilfisk
did you have a new one
what is this for
Peter went down to see about getting a motor in it
because its busted
so it is
it went
and they said
itll be a hundred and eighty pounds to put a motor
och for goodness sake sure you can buy a new one for
I says I says
no Im not giving him a hundred and eighty pounds to pay
I says
in fact I could buy the whole thing for a hundred and eighty
I just needta go to the toilet
good girl
thats a good girl
because they say that vacuums should last you years and years
I know
how old is it
about five or six years
God no I mean
my mummie has hers about twenty
well now mines mine would be about three or four years old I
but when I got it I bought a Nilfisk thinking that I was going to
and thats why I bought it
well my mums a GM two hundred
so is mine
its the same one
well you see when I
well I dont
I mean I lifted the ashes with it
but I would have cleaned round the fire
aye aye
you see thats what wrecks them
is it
uhhuh
but I would never buy a Nilfisk
I feel like writing to them and telling them that
why why would you not buy another one
well I dont think Ill
I think the suction was great in it compared to like the old one I
well now do you see Alices
Alices is an older version
and the suction in that
see the ones we have the its nothing to the older ones
is that right
well my mummie lent me an old one she had
aye aye that will do you in the meantime
its not lifting up half the stuff
it will do you in the meantime
I dont have the money to go out and buy another one at the minute
I know
oh I know its the same
because were skint
I know
I know
I know
I know anyway
I think Ill keep the Nilfisk
and maybe eventually even an old
just buying a wee vacuum cleaner thatll keep me going
and maybe eventually get a motor for it
well it depends on how much it would cost to rebuild it
it cost an awful lot of money
it was like the time we went with the washing machine
it cost one hundred and twenty pounds to fix it
and they had already fixed the bag on it
so you can get a new washing machine for three hundred and fifty
I said like
its ten years old
so I said
one hundred and twenty five for a timer you can get a new one
thats a wee bear
we have read that one before too
I showed you that before
no
come here to you see this
what

you make it up
you just make up whatever story you like
why dont you tell it to me
I dont really know it
you make it up
sure youre very good at making things up
I know you would be
because you can say anything at all Barbara that you wanna
because you are virtually on the threshold of adult language here
you really are
but if I dont know all the bits
well you can just make them up
start off with
one day one day
no I know the one about the kitchen
right you tell me that one then
they went to the kitchen and they got some tea
and
did they
yeah
oh gosh what did they do
they made a mess of the table cloth
and they made a mess of their clothes
and they made a mess of mess of their hair
what happened when their mummie got up and she opened the door
there was all the mess
and she smacked the wee girl
did she my goodness
and then what happened
they didnt get any sweets or no nothing
oh ho ho youre a clever girl
and then they only got them juice

absolutely
and theres not one of them Ive seen as nice
does this make a noise

does this make a noise
so we met a fella

Peter actually works
he actually knew this guy
does this make a noise
and he says
come on in and have a look
and he had bought it for
does it make a noise
no it doesnt
batterys not working
sixty seven two years ago

aye
and Ill sell it to you
and the houses were going for fifty seven
and like the Jordanstown Road thats very
oh I know
they were four bedroom houses
so they were
but theres no way Cathy
I just couldnt
it would just take us to our limits
well not with you not working now

and uh we wouldnt be able to live
and I wouldnt put that pressure on myself
I know
I know
and the kitchen the kitchen Cathy I walked round it

I wouldnt
the worry and all
because I wouldnt even be able to go and out and get new carpet
that would hafta do
I know

I know
and then there was another he had a Norwich Union
he got with that too
different policy

it was a very small policy
that was good
it was to do when
its a trivial like
its only about five pound a month
I know it doesnt matter
but you got them for that as well
three hundred of them
well that was good
so thats another thousand
oh thats thats brilliant
thats good
well the best thing about it was that you got them for the
although I didnt have one for Kathryn I missed it
but I got two hundred for Adams one
we got two hundred
if used what savings
I know
and uh the week before he had lifted a hundred pound out to
and if wed another seven pound in our account we would ev
but we didnt
like he near cried his eyes out over it
I says
they sent you enough letters out
you didnt read them
I know
um our mortgage is through them
so we got two hundred for it
that was good
fifteen hundred its not to be laughed at having said that
brilliant brilliant

the rest of it is all flat
Im going to walk
and Ill get a bus down home again
so I will
now my father in law would come and pick me up
but hes not able Cathy
so hes not
but I do wanna walk up
Ive sixteen inches off all over so I have
but I hafta start
what do you mean
inches
yes Ive six and a half inches off each hip
youre looking great
its hard going isnt it Kyle
I love your hair
it needs done again Cathy
it needs washed
I hadta completely strip when I came home
because I was absolutely soaking with sweat
because I put my big green coat on
hello darling
let me see your sweat shirt
wait to I stop this Barbara
and then you can watch it
do you want a cup of tea Cathy
I wouldnt mind one
I had my lunch
but I didnt get a cup of tea
so I wouldnt mind
that would be lovely
what did you get
a Pingu Magazine
would you read it for me
I will indeed
we could look at it together couldnt we
yes because my mummie is too busy tidying up
yes sometimes that just happens
tell me this
first of all you hafta tell me all about nursery school
I dont know what I done
and I dont know about it
yes you do
what did you do this morning
were you painting
playdough as you can see from her
Cathy sit up on the seat
that floors bogging
I have seen it before
I do have a three year old you know
mustard arent youse
hows he been
great
youre all the picture of health
Im feeling a lot better now the weights starting to come off
like Cathy youd no idea
it really was depressing me
now let me talk to Cathy
and then you can have it read
okay because I havent seen mummie for ages
so I joined that Rosemary Conley class
did you
now I havent really
Ive had people over staying
and Ive been up on and off
so I have
but basically its only the weekend I have bother
wed have an Indian
do you not miss sweets and stuff and chocolate
its the biscuits I couldnt give up
no Im not
Im not having butter or anything or cheese or anything like that
well are you having a proper dinner at night
God like youre full on it
you eat plenty
is it just a change in what youre eating then
healthy eating you cut out fat
you have your red meat
and now I would have my Bolognese
but when youre cooking for a family its very hard
now Ive bought a lot of stuff out of Marks
because she does a lot of stuff for Marks
and theres fat free which you can bung in the microwave
and thats handy
I just dont cream my potatoes
I take them whole
but you have your meat and everything like
I think I could do that alright
but its
Cathy you dont needta lose weight
oh I do
you dont Cathy
I do honestly
Ive put on an awful lot
now thats June or the beginning of May I started
and as I say the last time I measured myself it was sixteen inches
you measure your arm and everything
Ive only lost about half a stone
but its all coming off my legs
thats really good
and my bum
but its still on my belly
you see thats where mine is
I cant get it off my tummy
but thats him sure
and I can get in to my blouses
I think once youve had them its hard
now she asked me what I wanted to lose
now I was fourteen stone
and I lost six pounds in the first week
I was fourteen six
and now Im down to
how often do you go
once a week
and we have a wee exercise class and everything
and its good crack Cathy
it gets me out
it just gets me out
and it clears my head
you needta do something
Im starting aerobics next week
Im going to do that
its on in the primary school
I feel like I need toned up more than lose weight
you definitely dont needta lose weight
Im heavier now than Ive ever been
well so am I
I dont ever expect to get down to what I was
but that depresses me
I wouldnt go by weight
because when I see how little weight Ive lost an how many inches
sixteen and a half inches Ive taken off
but do you not look in the mirror and say
Im disgusted with myself
I say where have you gone to
you hafta do situps
and I says
when do you want me to do them
if I get two minutes I like to sit down bit
I am going to start walking
that would be tremendous
the trouble is when its wet or when its windy or cold
well I dont mind the wind
and I dont mind the cold
its the rain
but I have the plastic cover
and hell be well hopped up
Im not worried about that
but I wouldnt walk her
it was just too far for her
so Ill get a bus
where are you going
wheres your juice
hes getting awful big
I hadta go out this week and get him
nothing fits him
I brought some clothes for him
but they may not fit him
oh brilliant
Ill give you them now in case I forget
anything that was bought to him is too small
theres not much in that Ruth
I was just literally clearing out stuff yesterday
www
brilliant Cathy

they were all Adams
and theyve been lying about the place
thatll do me great
hes a dirty thing

here you are wee man
thanks Ruth
its nearly time to read
its just I havent seen mummie for so long
weve so much to catch up on
oh
hes got really big
hes massive
but hes got really big over the summer
and hes pulling himself up and all
is he
and hes got six teeth
goodness
and hes very very pleasant
is he still as pleasant
still as pleasant
although he shouts doesnt he Barbara
do you want a biscuit darling
those are lovely leggings
theyre nice and bright ones
nobodyll lose you in them sure they wont
shes got big too
look at the length of her
everything I bought her at Easter nothing fits her
its terrible Cathy
sure I went into down last Friday and bought Kathryn a load of
the stuffs awful dear isnt it
and a coat
twenty five pounds for a winter coat
now both her coats that she got last year both of them still fit
thats good
I learnt my lesson at Easter going out and buying her
shell get as she needs Cathy
because weve put in a terrible summer
I think actually we could have been down to
well Im sure
but he must have been entitled to something
there was weeks he was doing nothing
we were lucky
just between my endowment coming out and different wee things I
but what are you going to do next year
hes just going to hafta get more work next year
I says
you can stay at home and look after the kids
and Ill go and get a job
but he wouldnt last two days
he wouldnt Cathy
but with him on the coal and all thats awful hard
youve only got that in the winter
sure nobody buys in the summer
we find that what money youre making in the winter you need during
and this year even in the winter we were paying back what we owed
and we didnt get anywhere
were lucky we had that money mind you
I was going to do wonders with that money
and I hadta pay bloody bills with it
I could have cried my eyes out
so I did
Ive still the money for my holiday to Canada
but as long as I have that I dont care
I could get through anything
but I told him after that
heres me
you can go out and beg steal or borrow
but Im not spending anymore of that
mummie I wanna read my story
well at least youre getting to Canada
I know
thats what I mean
Ive paid off visas and everything
I want somebody to read me this story
I promise Ill read you that in one wee minute
and in fact Ive got other ones with me today
because mummiell read you that one later on
I brought some other ones for you to see and one for you to keep
so I dont wanna go through a summer like this
but next year if he doesnt get anything Ill hafta get something
and hell hafta look after the kids
and God love him
will you look at them now
thats for you to keep
what do you say
thank you
and thats because youre such a clever girl
and someday if mummie ever has a minute you can sit down or
you could take it to Granny Sadies house
because Granny Sadie has lots of time to do that sort of thing
and theres all the wee letters
and itll teach you some of the words
because Im sure you know some of these by now
do you know what that means
no
shes going to be able to read this year
she doesnt recognize
she will
do you think so
do you think itll come quick enough
with her no bother
but theyre all in that
and you take them out with stickers and put the in against like
I know
now I dont want it ruined Barbara
wait until mummie has the time to do it
thats monkey
but some of them are big hard ones
monkey is a big hard word to learn
you start of with wee words like
monkey
oh I know you know that one
but what happens is that you learn to read them and look at the
and you see the letters together
and you take it out and you put it beside the other ones
well take this one out
but thats the only one well do okay
okay
see the wee pussycat
what sort of words that
cl al tl for cat
thats right
isnt it cl al tl for cat
now thats a hard word
a very hard word
you keep all the other ones and some day you can do those with

theyre awful cold the Royal Family arent they

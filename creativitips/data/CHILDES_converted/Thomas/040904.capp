*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: Mum .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: crayons fall down this hole .
*CHI: will they .
*MOT: pardon .
*CHI: fall down this hole .
*MOT: well Im not quite sure what we do with it actually .
*MOT: um lets have a look .
*CHI: Im staying .
*MOT: right we can either do this with it look .
*MOT: can either do that with it .
*MOT: or you can make a cross track one like that .
*CHI: staying .
*CHI: no stay .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: Im not quite sure how theyve done that actually .
*MOT: oh I see .
*MOT: you can put .
*MOT: right lets have a look .
*MOT: how have they done that Thomas .
*MOT: um .
*CHI: piece .
*MOT: how have they managed to do that .
*MOT: oh I see .
*MOT: that must come on to a piece of track that youve already got .
*MOT: is that what theyre saying .
*CHI: Mum I just wanna make a long track here .
*CHI: one of a double track .
*MOT: but I cant .
*CHI: I .
*CHI: and one of the buffers went .
*CHI: uh a middle one .
*CHI: like Gordon 0 .
*MOT: just trying to see it from the picture how how they can .
*MOT: was there nothing else in the box Thomas .
*MOT: oh I see .
*CHI: oh .
*MOT: look at that .
*MOT: so you can have a buffer at .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: there .
*MOT: I just .
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: then you put your other train track what youve got already .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: or you can make a long one .
*CHI: I want a long one .
*MOT: okay .
*CHI: come on lets build .
*CHI: lets build a very long one .
*MOT: you want a train track first .
*CHI: lets start here .
*MOT: okay well youre very good at building .
*MOT: why dont you build a .
*CHI: because I want you to build some .
*MOT: oh Ill build some .
*CHI: you build .
*MOT: we saw that in Tesco didnt we .
*MOT: another time when we go Thomas we can buy a bit more .
*MOT: but .
*CHI: can I put a song on for you on the telephone .
*MOT: yes please .
*CHI: I show you how do you do it .
*MOT: yeah .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: you just press two .
*CHI: two .
*CHI: eight .
*CHI: one .
*CHI: then you press this one thats on up .
*MOT: is that how you make a little song .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: right are you going to stop and well get the track out of the .
*MOT: Thomas are you okay .
*MOT: oh dear .
*MOT: the phone .
*MOT: well when we go another time well see if we can perhaps get .
*CHI: more buffers .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I dont think we need more buff .
*MOT: well see when weve made this .
*MOT: weve got the engine shed .
*MOT: so that stops the track there .
*MOT: weve got buffers .
*MOT: youve got two .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: need .
*CHI: if Gordon was rushing through then .
*CHI: oh buffers .
*MOT: what did you say .
*MOT: if Gordon was rushing through .
*CHI: um and then he saw danger .
*CHI: and the points switched to Gordon .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: onto the buffer track .
*CHI: yes .
*MOT: they had like this didnt they .
*MOT: they had more of a type ones today .
*MOT: now truck ones .
*MOT: like this one .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: look Mum .
*CHI: you can still .
*MOT: I thought youd been drawing on that but I think it must be more .
*MOT: Grandad some things to glue with wood .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: right well lets get this ready because when we find .
*MOT: was it from one of these that we got the turntable .
*MOT: no .
*CHI: come on Mum help me .
*MOT: look I am helping you .
*CHI: no youre not .
*CHI: just sitting there doing nothing .
*MOT: helping you do this um piece of something thats missing .
*MOT: because Im just thinking Grandad or whatever it is he uses .
*MOT: if Grandad could glue that back in then that would uh .
*CHI: yeah .
*CHI: ask him .
*CHI: ask him on the telephone .
*MOT: its no good asking cant do it over the telephone can he ?
*MOT: I dont even know what its come from though Thomas .
*MOT: ah yes I do .
*MOT: its from there .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: okay .
*CHI: chuffachuffao .
*CHI: come on Mum .
*CHI: well build this high .
*MOT: very good .
*MOT: now do you want it to come round in a continuous .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: I want it to go in a real railway track .
*MOT: well thats what I mean .
*MOT: so theres no end .
*MOT: that darling .
*CHI: bridge .
*MOT: well Ill let you put things where you want .
*CHI: can you help me .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: this goes here .
*CHI: that um turntable .
*MOT: turntable there .
*CHI: okay now this is where weve got to block it off .
*CHI: no its not .
*MOT: no but what I mean is if .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: well weve got the engine shed .
*MOT: that block stays off doesnt it .
*CHI: this buffer something else .
*CHI: like the express .
*CHI: if theyre not careful the express will go .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: smasho .
*CHI: lets play 0 .
*CHI: leader follow the leader .
*CHI: leader follow the leader .
*CHI: leader follow the leader .
*CHI: follow the leader .
*CHI: hope .
*CHI: I Im just trying to get all this to go .
*MOT: well yes it will do .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: to go under that bridge .
*CHI: yep .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: youre doing very well actually Thomas .
*MOT: doing very well .
*MOT: thats it .
*MOT: right what do you wanna do .
*MOT: go bring it round so it joins on on this end .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: because there arent any gaps in the track .
*MOT: you know how we usually have things run off the end .
*CHI: we needed to put .
*MOT: break darling .
*MOT: its too stretched there .
*MOT: thats going to break .
*CHI: use one of these .
*MOT: yes I think we needta use .
*MOT: dont you .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: theyre .
*MOT: sorry .
*CHI: building .
*CHI: do you like my building .
*MOT: I think we need .
*MOT: snapped .
*MOT: there .
*CHI: all the buffers .
*CHI: oh here .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: I think really we could do with a bit of straight track .
*CHI: yeah we could .
*MOT: we keep buying bits but we never seem to ever have enough do we ?
*CHI: no .
*CHI: have you noticed what I 0have done .
*MOT: what have you done .
*MOT: oh Thomas .
*MOT: I cant say I had noticed but now that youve pointed it out .
*CHI: oy .
*MOT: oh Thomas Lastname .
*MOT: me .
*CHI: just stretched .
*MOT: will it not go .
*CHI: wheres the other bit of .
*MOT: stretch .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: something else round here Thomas because .
*MOT: weve got too many .
*CHI: thats why I need some .
*MOT: Thomas that smell is absolutely vile .
*MOT: there thats better .
*MOT: great now isnt it .
*CHI: mhm .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: you bumped my botty .
*MOT: right now are you going to put the engine shed on that .
*CHI: hm .
*MOT: its here look .
*MOT: Im just thinking if we brought .
*CHI: oh Mum .
*MOT: you needta do .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: how are we going to do this .
*MOT: we need that to go onto something .
*MOT: we might hafta .
*MOT: thats it .
*MOT: ah yes .
*MOT: do you think well hafta turn everything round .
*MOT: is that what we hafta do .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: goodness me .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: I think with the rest well hafta use something else .
*MOT: on there .
*CHI: no its not .
*MOT: not like this idea .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: we seem a bit stuck arent we .
*MOT: now the trouble is things are going to go flying off there Thomas .
*CHI: thats why the buffers not for that .
*CHI: its for Gordon to go 0 .
*MOT: perhaps what well hafta do .
*MOT: is do that and that changes .
*MOT: this probably sounds very noisy building this on a wooden .
*MOT: wooden train track on a wooden floor .
*MOT: do you think its a bit noisy .
*CHI: yes .
*CHI: but its quite good actually .
*MOT: is it .
*CHI: oh now Ive got a problem here .
*MOT: whats the problem .
*CHI: uhoh .
*MOT: yes well thats why the other buffer needs to go over there .
*MOT: thats what I was .
*CHI: cant .
*CHI: wheres the other buffer .
*MOT: its behind you .
*MOT: but then how are things going to drive over there .
*MOT: look it turns upside down like that .
*CHI: good .
*MOT: you dont want that there .
*CHI: no but I want it like that .
*CHI: will this fit .
*CHI: this bit fits on here .
*MOT: right .
*CHI: a buffer there .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: and a .
*MOT: look weve got .
*MOT: its going to break here I think .
*MOT: its too isnt it .
*CHI: buffer there .
*CHI: there .
*CHI: um where should this buffer go .
*MOT: right .
*CHI: somethings .
*MOT: whats broken .
*MOT: well thats on the end of that piece .
*MOT: put it back in .
*MOT: thats the piece I was saying youve got to save for your Grandad .
*MOT: havent you .
*CHI: where does this buffer should go .
*MOT: whats the matter Thomas .
*MOT: me that and everytime I tell you you say .
*MOT: so dont ask me anymore .
*MOT: you know where it should go .
*CHI: where should it go .
*MOT: well it should go on the other part of the buffer .
*CHI: cant .
*CHI: needta click onto something .
*MOT: yeah it clicks onto this bit Thomas .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: it shouldnt its my .
*MOT: this is where you keep asking me where it should go and when I tell .
*CHI: dont no the proper way .
*CHI: where should it go .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: well dont ask me any more then .
*CHI: where should it go .
*CHI: its not going here .
*MOT: well you turn that piece round and thats where it goes .
*CHI: well where .
*MOT: yes you turn that piece round and put it across ways .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: like I showed you .
*CHI: where should .
*MOT: stop whinging .
*CHI: I dont want it there in my railway because then buffers .
*MOT: well look this didnt come with the set .
*MOT: take that .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: okay I wont play then .
*MOT: well thats fair enough .
*MOT: Im sure you can work that bit .
*MOT: that thing is it .
*CHI: but it is my railway .
*MOT: I know it is but you keep asking me where the buffer goes and I .
*MOT: on the floor there .
*MOT: see it .
*CHI: up .
*MOT: no its only a tiny spider .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: are you warm .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: you feel very warm .
*CHI: here .
*CHI: then .
*MOT: thats a good one .
*MOT: well done .
*CHI: which train shall be which .
*MOT: well I think you needta join this end up otherwise youre going to .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: your trains are not going to be able to join up are they .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: I think instead of that bit curving round there it needs to go .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: this is the stop bit .
*CHI: laughs this is a tricky bit .
*MOT: it is a bit tricky .
*CHI: laughs .
*MOT: but its not going to join up is it .
*CHI: but I like it like that .
*MOT: do you .
*MOT: fair enough .
*MOT: whats the matter .
*CHI: my .
*MOT: your eye hurts .
*CHI: you just get building .
*CHI: um .
*MOT: right .
*CHI: laughs ah heres the truck .
*CHI: I trucks .
*CHI: I carry truckies .
*CHI: I carry tru uh ucks .
*MOT: so really we could do with a bit more of the buffer thing .
*MOT: do you think we could do with more buffers Thomas .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: oh theres quite a lot to build today .
*MOT: ones .
*MOT: oh join this up .
*CHI: oh okay then .
*MOT: theres no gaps in that track .
*CHI: thats .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: choo choo .
*CHI: choo choo track .
*CHI: truck just pretend truck trains were not invented yet .
*MOT: right okay .
*MOT: just trying to think where can you go .
*MOT: we weve got to join this end havent we .
*CHI: yeah we have .
*CHI: this should .
*CHI: oh .
*MOT: I think its a little bit too long really .
*MOT: perhaps we needta block it off earlier down there Thomas .
*CHI: block .
*MOT: in which case well hafta take some of the track off there .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: its not .
*MOT: so weve got a double bridge now .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: thatll work wont it .
*MOT: are you sniffing .
*MOT: why dont you go and get a tissue .
*CHI: nope .
*MOT: why are you .
*CHI: trains are invented now .
*MOT: are they .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: havent got .
*MOT: feel .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: oh lordy lordy .
*CHI: why did you say lordy lordy .
*MOT: because I useta think it was quite good to make a train track .
*MOT: and now its so hard .
*MOT: so very complicated .
*CHI: hello .
*MOT: that best bit to put the bridge wouldnt it .
*CHI: Mum Mum you drive the blue bit dont you .
*MOT: do I .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: guess what .
*MOT: Ive got it to work .
*MOT: but the only .
*CHI: problem .
*MOT: yes well Im changing all that round .
*MOT: the only the only other problem is that I have a cup of coffee .
*MOT: watch you dont bump into that because I dont want a burnt leg .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: you drive .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: www .
*MOT: to move Purdies bed .
*CHI: mhm .
*CHI: definitely .
*MOT: Thomas .
*MOT: get off my foot .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: no no .
*MOT: no I dont like that .
*MOT: why dont we move this bit over there .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: no we cant .
*MOT: no because it wont work will it .
*CHI: I want it to work .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: it wont .
*MOT: its broken at the track .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: its .
*CHI: Im going to put this away in a minute .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: there .
*CHI: I needta be .
*MOT: do you .
*MOT: why are you going to break it up .

*CHI: Im gonna be stuck .
*MOT: you think what .
*CHI: Im gonna .
*MOT: stuck .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: I am stuck now .
*CHI: I am stuck .
*MOT: I am .
*CHI: oh help me .
*CHI: get the buffers away .
*CHI: on my track .
*MOT: well I tried to tell you putting buffers there right in the .
*CHI: no please .
*MOT: what .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: help .
*MOT: well where are you stuck .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: this is the most complicated .
*MOT: bit of engineering weve every come across .
*MOT: isnt it .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: to go onto the turntable .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: beepo honkhonko .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: it still isnt joining up to anything Thomas .
*MOT: oh this is hard .
*CHI: bumble .
*MOT: buffer there .
*CHI: oh buffers .
*MOT: buffers in the whatsits .
*MOT: whatsits .
*MOT: it reminds me of the uh Thomas The Tank Engine books .
*MOT: when he gets cross he says and he .
*MOT: oh wheels and wipers .
*CHI: oh my wheels and wipers .
*MOT: is that what he says .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: my wheels and wipers .
*CHI: and he says this when hes very angry .
*CHI: my windows blingoesc .
*MOT: my windows blingoesc .
*MOT: what .
*MOT: what does that mean .
*CHI: I dont know .
*MOT: I dont know .
*CHI: another train has come .
*MOT: is that Teletubbies come to play .
*CHI: I wanna engineer man .
*MOT: do you .
*CHI: you be the train driver be .
*MOT: put that there cant we .
*CHI: no Im the engineer now .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: and what do we do with that bit though Thomas .
*CHI: well youre the train driver .
*MOT: oh well if Im the train driver the track isnt my .
*CHI: oh my problem .
*MOT: what can we do with this .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: there .
*CHI: you youre the train driver .
*MOT: am I .
*CHI: you are .
*MOT: whoops .
*CHI: stop engineering .
*CHI: Im gonna .
*MOT: engineering .
*MOT: putting a buffer there .
*CHI: yes .
*MOT: but then what .
*MOT: we dont track any more .
*MOT: do we .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: oh dear deary me .
*CHI: uh oy oy .
*CHI: how dare you .
*CHI: on my railway .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: its that little bit we needta get Grandad .
*MOT: I didnt even notice that .
*CHI: Mum .
*MOT: weve got a few more pieces so I thought having more pieces would .
*CHI: yes .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: now Thomas stop it .
*CHI: Mum .
*MOT: Im going to sit in the chair and drink my .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: come on drive the train laughs .
*CHI: drive the .
*CHI: tickle mine .
*MOT: really want it to go under the .
*CHI: yes .
*MOT: I think this is where our problem is .
*MOT: have we not got more buffers now .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: because I just think how are we gonna end this .
*MOT: well .
*CHI: well buy nine .
*MOT: weve got .
*CHI: packets .
*MOT: get another packet of buffers because thats what we we .
*CHI: which shall we put nine buffers .
*MOT: well the two in the box .
*MOT: thats got stuck .
*MOT: so I think we could certainly do with more buffers because then we .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: and we could block that end off .
*MOT: right I dont think were going to get a drive anywhere at all on .
*CHI: yes you can .
*MOT: hm laughs .
*MOT: we needta perhaps bring it round this way .
*MOT: its got to go in a loop hasnt it .
*CHI: no it dont needta go in a loop .
*CHI: come on Mum drive .
*MOT: but I cant drive .
*CHI: yes you can drive .
*MOT: Ill hit the buffer .
*CHI: oh yes you .
*MOT: Thomas have you made another smell .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: that corner then .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: problem .
*CHI: Ive got a problem as well .
*MOT: what sort of one .
*CHI: look .
*MOT: I know weve lost the carriages havent we .
*CHI: thats why you needta .
*MOT: what in to reverse and couple .
*CHI: and then pretend you forgot um .
*MOT: right .
*CHI: Mum I need you to go back down down this hill .
*CHI: this track .
*MOT: okay fine .
*MOT: dediddlydumo .
*MOT: oh Im doing great now .
*MOT: dediddlydumo .
*CHI: and he did not see the buffers .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: oh oh dear .
*MOT: oh dear .
*MOT: we had a problem getting over the bridge .
*CHI: everythings fallen to pieces .
*MOT: right shall I try again .
*MOT: I think its too long .
*MOT: its a bit of a strange train this .
*MOT: its an express train .
*MOT: me carry .
*MOT: 0 .
*CHI: chooo .
*CHI: to jump out and push .
*CHI: and then I 0will help you .
*CHI: 0 .

*MOT: I didnt know they had a brush and shovel .
*FAT: dont use it .
*MOT: they dont use it at all .
*MOT: I was just thinking that the next time they make a mess Ill shout .
*MOT: we usually get the controls on the other side dont we .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: right you see he could use his brush and shovel now because .
*MOT: it looks like a piece of bread .
*CHI: rubbish .
*MOT: oh a packet or something .
*MOT: off he goes .
*CHI: stop .
*CHI: use your shovel .
*CHI: lets play now .
*MOT: well lets hold on a moment .

*MOT: I dont know which one it is .
*MOT: let me just turn one of the microphones off .
*MOT: oh its that one .
*MOT: right its this one thats the problem .
*MOT: okay so we keep an eye on it .
*MOT: okay right are we going to carry on with this train track ?
*MOT: come on dont be silly Thomas .
*MOT: no it keeps flashing on .
*MOT: Im going to go and stop the tape .
*MOT: okay .
*CHI: I want Jeannine to record record us .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: Ive just moved it round a little bit .
*MOT: I dont know if thatll make any difference but uh .
*MOT: no its still flashing .
*MOT: theres really nothing I can do .
*MOT: we either spend all the whole hour bothering about the orange .
*CHI: or we play .
*MOT: or we play .
*CHI: thats right .
*CHI: I wanna play .
*MOT: right I hope youve not been sitting in Purdies bed Thomas .
*MOT: right do you like this train track now Ive sorted it out .
*CHI: um actually its a building site .
*MOT: its not a building site .
*CHI: it is .
*CHI: I can to be a building site .
*MOT: oh fair enough .
*MOT: okay it can be a building site then .
*MOT: do you still want the crane .

*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: did you know it had broken .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: did you know it had gone missing though .

*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: Rolly the steam roller .
*MOT: look at the size of it compared to the mixer .
*MOT: right Im just trying to .
*CHI: whats happening to the mixer .
*CHI: Mickey .
*MOT: Mickey .
*MOT: is it .
*MOT: oh shush Thomas .
*CHI: sorry .
*MOT: no dont make too much noise .
*MOT: Thomas .
*MOT: thats very very loud .
*MOT: right there we are .
*MOT: Ive managed to tie it back on .
*CHI: they pour the cement into my bucket .
*MOT: are you .
*MOT: so why has the train track suddenly become a building site .
*MOT: I dont understand that .
*CHI: thats why the train tracks got a crack .
*MOT: oh I see because one of the wooden um rails has got a .
*CHI: no its not a building site .
*CHI: its still a train .
*MOT: oh its a train track but you need some building machines to repair .
*MOT: is that correct .
*MOT: I see .
*MOT: you know when you went out with Daddy .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: just after youd gone I came back through here .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: and I thought oh thats what I needta do with the train track .

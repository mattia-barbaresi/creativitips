*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: they get paid .
*CHI: mm .
*MOT: and the money that they earn goes into the bank .
*MOT: and then its there in the bank for me to take out .
*MOT: which is why Mummy works hard to earn pennies .
*MOT: and why when we go to the cash machine theres usually money there
*MOT: and you can only take out the amount youve got if youve no money
*MOT: and thats why many times when were shopping and you see things
*MOT: you know you cant have you cant buy absolutely everything you

*MOT: well I would imagine thats quite an expensive one .
*CHI: ask Jeannine .
*MOT: ask Jeannine ?
*CHI: it might be one pound .
*MOT: well it might be a pound but I doubt it very because I think

*CHI: go whoowhoowhooo .
*CHI: I tip 0it in .
*CHI: like cement .

*MOT: lets make sure weve got all the mix in .
*MOT: clever boy .
*MOT: gosh thats clever .
*MOT: that really was clever .
*MOT: there we are .

*MOT: that little fork .
*MOT: okay .
*CHI: you can have little big one .
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: its a bit of a chopping isnt it .
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: I would imagine the mix has flour and sugar and perhaps .
*MOT: now normally if we were making biscuits Mummy would just get flour .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: and weigh it out .
*MOT: no Thomas .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: keep it here .
*MOT: youre going to need that later .
*CHI: alright .
*MOT: thats it .
*MOT: if you dont need it now just pop it on the table .

*CHI: oh dear dear .
*CHI: I needta roll it again .

*MOT: oh no .
*MOT: dont put it on the table Thomas .

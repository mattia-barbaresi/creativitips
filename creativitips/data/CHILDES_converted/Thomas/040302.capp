*MOT: but nothing happened to her .
*MOT: then one of the neighbors must have been doing some painting .
*MOT: Purdie walked and past and came in with paint all down her side .
*CHI: was it funny .

*MOT: well no .
*MOT: the the problem is with pussy cat .
*MOT: she can cats clean themselves .
*CHI: lick .
*MOT: yeah .
*CHI: uh yucky poo .
*MOT: so if youre covered in paint .
*MOT: and you lick it off .
*MOT: whats going to happen .
*MOT: the paints going to go in your mouth .
*CHI: uh .
*MOT: and paint is poisonous .
*MOT: so I hadta stop her licking it off .
*MOT: a lot of paint doesnt just wash off .
*MOT: although actually I think this did .
*MOT: so what I did .
*MOT: we held her down .
*MOT: got scissors and cut off as much as we could .
*MOT: and then we bathed her .
*MOT: which she didnt like .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: but at least it stopped her from licking the paint .
*MOT: I think if a cats very very badly covered in paint .
*MOT: you know if say a paint pot falls on their head or something .
*CHI: laughs .
*MOT: I think you hafta go to the vets really .
*MOT: to get them sorted out .
*MOT: unless its a paint that you can just wash off in the shower .
*CHI: it goes owo meow .
*MOT: but cats dont like water .
*MOT: the trouble is because Purdies old .
*MOT: if we hadta give her a bath now .
*CHI: mhm .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: shed probably get very upset .
*MOT: and that in itself might make her poorly .
*CHI: bathing puss cats thats okay .
*MOT: well no .
*MOT: its okay to bath them .
*MOT: but they absolutely hate it .
*MOT: I have bathed her on several occasions .
*CHI: hm .
*MOT: sometimes when shes come in very very dirty .
*MOT: the thing is now .
*CHI: hm .
*CHI: poo .
*MOT: Thomas .
*MOT: stop it .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: shes I know shes elderly or olderlyc .
*MOT: what do you say .
*CHI: olderlyc .
*MOT: well thats not a word .
*MOT: elderly is a word .
*MOT: and old is the word .
*CHI: olderlyc .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: well olderlyq is your your own little word .
*MOT: but its quite cute .
*MOT: olderlyc .
*MOT: um no .
*MOT: Purdie doesnt explore quite as much now does she .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: why does she not chase mice anymore .
*MOT: oh Im sure she still chases mice .
*MOT: I think she would .
*MOT: but the only thing is we havent got mice round here .
*MOT: thank goodness .
*MOT: although again Im sure we we have mice .
*MOT: we have .
*MOT: because Ive seen one in the sweet peas last year .
*MOT: definitely saw a mouse .
*MOT: in fact weve had one since then .
*MOT: but what I mean is .
*MOT: I havent actually seen Purdie with a mouse but uh .
*MOT: when you were a baby .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: one day Purdie had a mouse .
*MOT: out just outside of this door .
*MOT: 0 .
*MOT: and I remember you were in your little rocker top thing .
*MOT: and I picked you up and put you on the table .
*MOT: and then I stood on the table .
*MOT: then I rang Linda next door .
*MOT: and I said oh Purdies got a mouse .
*MOT: and she said well I cant help you .
*MOT: and Linda and I were talking to each other .
*MOT: through the patio door .
*MOT: because the conservatory wasnt built in those days .
*MOT: we were talking to each other through the patio door .
*MOT: and we were watching Purdie with this mouse .
*MOT: and eventually .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: I managed to grab hold of Purdie .
*MOT: so that the mouse had time to run away from her .
*MOT: but its not as .
*CHI: raaho .
*MOT: oh Purdie wasnt happy with me .
*MOT: but the thing is I dont like mice .
*MOT: but it was a little field mouse .
*MOT: it wasnt as if it was in the house .
*MOT: and Purdies not a hungry animal .
*MOT: and the reason animals kill other animals is for food .
*MOT: to eat them .
*MOT: you know cats kill mice to eat them .
*MOT: but Purdie has loads of food .
*MOT: she doesnt needta kill a mouse to eat it .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: and its not fair .
*MOT: poor little mouse .
*MOT: imagine how frightened it must have been .
*MOT: while she was tossing it in the air .
*MOT: and play she was having fun .
*MOT: it was like Tom and Jerry .
*MOT: she thought it was great .
*MOT: chasing this poor little thing .
*MOT: so I held onto her .
*MOT: while the mouse ran away .
*MOT: and do you know what else shes had .
*CHI: what .
*MOT: well shes had birds .
*MOT: Ive seen her with birds .
*CHI: hm .
*MOT: and frogs .
*MOT: weve got frogs in our garden .

*MOT: and I looked at the container and thought it was all dirty water .

*MOT: we dont need them now .
*MOT: the next time I looked we had a little family of frogs .

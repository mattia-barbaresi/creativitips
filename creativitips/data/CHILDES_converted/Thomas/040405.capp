*MOT: staying in your mouth all night do you .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: what will it be like .
*MOT: well its not so much what it tastes like but .
*MOT: the juice is a bit acidy .
*MOT: acid its like lemon juice .
*MOT: lemon juice and vinegar are acid type things .
*MOT: and what it does .
*MOT: you know your teeth are nice and white .
*MOT: well the acid in the night when you are asleep .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: well not just when youre at night .
*MOT: all the time theres acid in your mouth .
*MOT: and it starts to eat away at the white enamel on your teeth .
*MOT: but .
*CHI: its a bit less .
*CHI: then it leaves new teeth that are black .
*MOT: yes thats right .
*MOT: it would damage the new teeth underneath .
*MOT: and so .
*MOT: when youve had something .
*MOT: to eat last thing at night .
*CHI: creatures in there .
*CHI: that like to nibble white things .
*MOT: 0 .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: its nothing in the drink .
*MOT: its just acid .
*MOT: its just whats coating your teeth .
*MOT: start to eat the white enamel .
*MOT: and make little holes .
*MOT: so if you brush your teeth before you go to bed .
*MOT: then it means .
*MOT: reduces the acid in your mouth .
*CHI: like .
*CHI: no .
*CHI: its a .
*CHI: theres one pound .
*MOT: pardon .
*CHI: grasses is one pound .
*MOT: pardon .
*CHI: one of grasses is one pound .
*MOT: dont know what you mean .
*CHI: grasses is one pound .
*MOT: grasses is one pound .
*MOT: whats that mean .
*CHI: asis .
*MOT: acid .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: acid .
*MOT: acid not grasses acid .
*MOT: and this is why you dont .
*CHI: acid .
*MOT: acid .
*MOT: this is why you dont .
*CHI: Sid thats Hollys Dad .

*CHI: theres a Sid .
*MOT: 0 .
*MOT: a Sid acid .
*CHI: I must not like him any more if hes a acid .
*MOT: no .
*CHI: uhoh .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: this is why you shouldnt eat sweets in between meals .
*MOT: because in between meals .
*MOT: theres enough saliva in your mouth .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: to take away the acid from the meal .
*MOT: as long as you dont put other rubbish in your mouth .
*MOT: before the next mealtime .
*MOT: and if you do .
*MOT: then the saliva hasnt got the chance to take the acid away .
*MOT: and youre putting more sugary sticky things on your teeth .
*MOT: and it just rots your teeth Tom .
*CHI: somebody dropped their teeth .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: rotten not dropped them .
*MOT: rot them .
*CHI: what will happen then .
*MOT: well the acid attacks the enamel .
*MOT: then you get a little hole in your tooth .
*MOT: and then oofo it hurts .
*CHI: Im glad I dont have it .
*MOT: well Im not saying youll never have it but .
*MOT: when you do something like drink juice just before going to bed .
*MOT: I think the best thing we can do for you .
*MOT: is to ask you to brush your teeth again .
*MOT: dont you .
*CHI: I wanna brush me own .
*MOT: oh you can do .
*CHI: yeah can I .
*MOT: yeah .
*CHI: really .
*CHI: yep .
*CHI: without you .
*MOT: well no .

*MOT: these work better I would imagine .
*MOT: now youre a bit older .

*CHI: wish I could cut things on me own .
*MOT: well you can cut things on your own .
*MOT: paper and things .
*MOT: although I still needta be around .
*MOT: I wouldnt let you loose cutting your own nails Tom .
*CHI: why .
*MOT: well because its quite a tricky job .
*MOT: and .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: if you cut them badly .
*MOT: or you cut the skin it would hurt an awful lot .
*CHI: then what would happen .
*MOT: well then youd have a poorly toe .
*CHI: then have stitches .
*MOT: well no .
*MOT: I dont think youd need stitches .

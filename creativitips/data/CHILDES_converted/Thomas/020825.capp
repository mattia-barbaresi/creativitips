*MOT: I had a huge tree in the flat .
*MOT: when the students had gone home for the holidays Mummy moved their .
*MOT: it almost reached the ceiling it was so big .
*MOT: and we got it decorated with lots of pretty things .
*MOT: and Purdie one Sunday morning ran right to the top of the .
*MOT: and knocked the whole tree over .
*MOT: and there was baubles and there was tinsel and bits of little .
*MOT: you remember the little pine cones from last year .
*MOT: all over the floor .
*MOT: Mummys voice is going now .

*MOT: so she ran right to the top .
*MOT: and the tree fell over .
*MOT: and all the baubles fell off .
*MOT: and the tinsel and the pine needles went everywhere .
*MOT: and Purdie was very very excited .

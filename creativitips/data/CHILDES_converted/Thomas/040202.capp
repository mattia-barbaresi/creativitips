*MOT: thats what the bl stands for .
*MOT: I bumped into bl .
*MOT: whats the bit that you bumped into ?
*MOT: that bit sticking up there .
*MOT: so you remember a line of letters first thing
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: bl for bump .
*MOT: bl for barrier .
*MOT: thats your bl .
*MOT: now further along the alphabet you step over the cl because the
*MOT: its got no bits sticking up .
*MOT: and then bother me  you bump into the dl .
*MOT: the dl .
*MOT: and the bit you bump into is
*MOT: is that one .
*MOT: so can you remember

*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: can you think .
*MOT: do you think you can remember that ?
*MOT: youre walking along and you bump into that barrier .
*MOT: thats bl .
*MOT: so the b@l
*MOT: you recognize bl because its got the barrier first and then the
*MOT: okay a barrier first and then a circle .
*MOT: you step over the cl and then you come to the dl and youre doing
*MOT: so you get over that roundy bit and the you bump into dl .
*MOT: what can we call that danger sign ?
*MOT: dl for danger ?
*CHI: dead .
*CHI: deadingc .
*CHI: zebra .

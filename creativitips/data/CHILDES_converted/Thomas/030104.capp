*MOT: you could almost manage it without me .
*MOT: Thomas had become conceited .
*MOT: he didnt realize that his driver was joking .
*MOT: you wont do you know what conceited means .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: it means he became very very smug and very sure of himself .
*MOT: later he boasted to the others .
*MOT: the driver says I dont need him now .
*MOT: dont be daft snorted Percy .
*MOT: Id never go without my driver said Toby earnestly .
*MOT: Id be frightened .
*MOT: poohq boasted Thomas .
*MOT: Im not scared .
*MOT: youd never dare said the other engines .
*MOT: I would though boasted Thomas .
*MOT: youll see .
*MOT: hes a bit show off is Thomas isnt he .
*CHI: wheres the driver .
*MOT: well I think this is what the problem is .
*MOT: Thomas has decided hes going to go without his driver .
*MOT: next morning the firemen came .
*MOT: Thomas drowsed comfortably in the shed as the warmth spread through .
*MOT: Percy and Toby were still asleep .
*MOT: Thomas opened his eyes and then he suddenly remembered silly .
*MOT: Ill show them .
*MOT: the driver hasnt come yet so here goes .
*MOT: he cautiously tried one piston then the other .
*MOT: Ill just go out and Ill stop and go whoosh .
*MOT: thatll make them jump .
*MOT: very .
*MOT: Thomas thought that he was being clever .
*MOT: but really he was only moving because a careless cleaner had .
*CHI: look .
*CHI: he looking down .
*MOT: he is isnt he .
*CHI: what for .
*MOT: a smile on his face hasnt he .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: it says Thomas thought that he was being clever .
*MOT: but really he was only moving because careless a careless .
*MOT: he soon found out his mistake .
*MOT: he tried to whoosh but he couldnt .
*MOT: he tried to stop but he couldnt .
*MOT: he just kept rolling along .
*MOT: the buffers will stop me he thought hopefully .
*MOT: but the siding had no buffers .
*MOT: Thomass wheels left the rails and crunched the tarmac .
*MOT: there was the station masters house .
*MOT: Thomas didnt dare to look at what was coming next .
*MOT: the station master and his family were just about to have breakfast .
*MOT: horrorsq cried Thomas and shut his eyes .
*MOT: there was a crash .
*MOT: and the house rocked and broken glass tinkled .
*MOT: plaster peppered the plates .
*CHI: please may I have see .
*MOT: well I dont think its actually .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: I was going to say I dont think it actually shows you but oh .
*CHI: Gordon uh pull tree on the line .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: a tree on the line .
*MOT: but I think its Thomas .
*MOT: I think its Thomas has smashed into the fat controllers house .
*MOT: a little bit like when that plate broke .
*MOT: what did it say on the previous page .
*CHI: crasho .
*MOT: crasho .
*MOT: lets read it again .
*MOT: there was a crash .
*MOT: and the house rocked and broken glass tinkled .
*MOT: plaster peppered the plates .
*MOT: that means that probably plaster from the ceiling fell down and .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: oh look .
*MOT: and Thomas had collected a bush on his travels .
*MOT: he peered anxiously into the room through its leaves .
*CHI: oh .
*MOT: the station master was furious .
*MOT: the station masters wife picked up her plate “you miserable .
*MOT: just look at what youve done to our breakfast .
*MOT: now I shall hafta cook some more .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: she banged the door .
*MOT: more plaster fell .
*MOT: this time it fell on Thomas .
*MOT: you see all the dust and rubble from the ceiling .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: oh Thomas felt depressed .
*MOT: that means he felt very sad .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: when youre depressed youre very sad .
*CHI: yes .
*MOT: Thomas felt depressed .
*MOT: the plaster was tickly .
*MOT: he wanted to sneeze but he didnt dare in case the house fell on .
*MOT: nobody came for a long time .
*MOT: everyone was much too busy .
*CHI: what happened there .
*MOT: well he crashed into the station masters house didnt he .
*MOT: because he thought he was clever enough to go on his own without a .
*MOT: and he wasnt .
*MOT: and he got into trouble when he found he couldnt stop .
*CHI: what all of that rope for .
*MOT: pardon .
*CHI: that .
*MOT: the rope .
*MOT: well I think theyre obviously going to hafta try and pull him out .
*MOT: now listen Thomas .
*MOT: you know sometimes when we go out of the front door .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: and you start running away and I shout stop .
*MOT: now the same sort of thing could happen to you .
*MOT: you think “oh I can go down there with Mummy” .
*MOT: its perfectly safe I dont need Mummy .
*MOT: but you do sometimes Thomas .
*MOT: because sometimes things happen .
*MOT: if youre running quickly and you couldnt stop and a car was .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: so its always better to wait isnt it .
*MOT: like Thomas should have waited for his driver .
*MOT: you should wait for Mummy .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: so now what has happened .
*MOT: it says Thomas was saying nobody came for a long time .
*MOT: but it looks now as if some workmen have come .
*CHI: whats that hook there .
*MOT: well normally I would imagine thats the hook .
*MOT: listen to the trains this morning .
*MOT: I cant get over that .
*MOT: I wonder if theres something special going on .
*MOT: theyre all going poop poop .
*MOT: I think that hook would normally couple the engine to the .
*MOT: the last workman propped up the house with strong poles and laid .
*MOT: that must be like scaffolding that we see on building sites holding .
*CHI: yeah .
*CHI: just a minute .
*CHI: I .
*MOT: not if you wanna turn the page .
*MOT: do you wanna see whats going on underneath .
*CHI: no I .
*MOT: do you know who they are .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: who are they .
*CHI: dont know .
*MOT: theyre twins .
*MOT: Donald and Douglas .
*MOT: we we met them in another story at Christmas .
*CHI: oh whats that one called .
*MOT: well I dont know theyre identical .
*MOT: but well call that one Donald and that one Douglas .
*MOT: I dont know which is which .
*MOT: Im sure they have different numbers on the engines .
*MOT: are they number nine and ten or ten and eleven .
*MOT: something like that .
*MOT: we came across them at Christmas Thomas .
*MOT: in that story about Thomas and the Christmas tree .
*MOT: because Donald and Douglas were the ones who shunted .
*MOT: at last workmen propped up the house with strong poles .
*MOT: and laid rails through the garden .
*MOT: Donald and Douglas arrived .
*MOT: ah they must be Scottish .
*MOT: because theyre saying theyre saying something about “well .
*MOT: but they way its written it sounds “well soon have you back .
*MOT: I cant do the accent .
*MOT: puffing hard the twins managed to haul Thomas back to safety .
*MOT: so I think that train is onto Thomas .
*MOT: and look it must be on the back of Donald and Douglas .
*MOT: bits of fencing the bush and a broken window frame festooned .
*MOT: that means they were all over Thomass front .
*MOT: which was badly twisted .
*MOT: he looked very funny .
*MOT: Thomas was in disgrace .
*MOT: but there was worse to come .
*MOT: that means Thomas is in a lot of trouble .
*MOT: you are a very naughty engine came a voice .
*MOT: “I know Sir” said Thomas .
*MOT: Im sorry Sir .
*MOT: Thomass voice was muffled behind his bush .
*MOT: look .
*MOT: can you see .
*MOT: he has got a bit of bush and all sorts on his face .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: you must go to the works and have your front end mended .
*MOT: it will be a long job said the fat controller .
*MOT: “oh yes Sir” faltered Thomas .
*MOT: meanwhile a Diesel rail car called Daisy will do your work .
*MOT: I think that happened before didnt it .
*MOT: Daisy stepped into the the breach before hasnt she .
*MOT: when something has happened to Thomas .
*MOT: diesel Sir .
*CHI: Daisy Sir Thomas spluttered .
*MOT: yes Thomas said the fat controller .
*MOT: diesels always stay in their sheds till they are wanted .
*MOT: diesels never gallivant off to breakfast in Station Masters houses .
*MOT: the fat controller turned on his heels and sternly walked away .
*MOT: oh gosh .
*MOT: now I think that should teach Thomas .
*MOT: laughs .
*MOT: another one .
*MOT: that should teach Thomas a lesson shouldnt it .
*MOT: he should not have gone off on his own should he .
*CHI: no no .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and Thomas you must learn from that story .
*MOT: you must never go off on your own .
*MOT: why are you looking cheeky .
*MOT: its only because I love you that I dont want you to go off on .
*MOT: what would Mummy do if you got knocked down by a car .
*MOT: shed cry wouldnt she .
*MOT: Id have no one to play with .
*CHI: Mummy .
*MOT: to bangadrumtimec because thered be no one .

*MOT: you just pretend .
*CHI: ah .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: youve only just touched it with your foot and I went oh
*MOT: Thomas it was so painful .
*MOT: I have never forgotten it and I have learnt my lesson because now
*CHI: hm ?
*MOT: I always well there are two things I learnt from that .
*MOT: one when I unplug it make jolly sure it is off the floor but the
*MOT: I went to stay with some friends in Jersey that you I don't
*CHI: no .
*MOT: I dont know whether you do because you were very young last time
*CHI: I dont remember her .
*MOT: but I went to stay with them .
*CHI: hm ?
*MOT: and we were going out for lunch and Id had a lovely shower .
*MOT: and done my hair but my hair was very different in those days .
*MOT: it was long .
*MOT: and I spent a long time using my hot brush .
*MOT: you know .
*MOT: the curling tongs .
*MOT: and I thought I looked really very smart and then off we went for
*MOT: I suddenly thought when I was in the car ahq .
*MOT: did I take did I turn the curling tongs off ?
*MOT: the heated well they werent heated rollers .
*MOT: you know the tongs .
*MOT: the styling brush .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: that Ive got upstairs .
*MOT: and I thought “oh did I unplug it” ?
*MOT: and all I could think of was this brush was just on the floor .
*MOT: on the little stand on the carpet and I thought “oh heavens if I've
*MOT: has it got so hot that the carpet will catch fire and Ill burn
*MOT: and I didnt know whether I should tell them that I was worried and
*MOT: and I didnt know whether hed be cross because Id make him drive
*MOT: oh I just didnt know what to do .
*MOT: I thought hed be even crosser if his house burns down .
*MOT: and it absolutely ruined what shouldve been a beautiful lunch .
*MOT: and we got home and the house was still standing and I went racing
*MOT: turned them off and unplugged them so I neednt of worried .
*MOT: but from that day onwards whenever I use anything .
*MOT: whether it was the iron or the hot brush .
*MOT: I make jolly sure I say to myself “right Ive unplugged it” .
*MOT: and I move it well away from the socket .
*MOT: to remind me that Ive unplugged it because it will frighten me .
*CHI: Mum  I want you to tell that story again .
*MOT: oh  Thomas .
*CHI: please .
*MOT: thats not even an interesting story .
*CHI: it is .
*MOT: I mean .
*MOT: youd like you would of liked it if .
*MOT: oh  guess what happened ?
*MOT: I left the hot brush on and by the time I came back from lunch the
*MOT: and the bedroom was on fire and the roof was on fire and there were
*MOT: neenawo neenawo neenawo .
*CHI: that was good .
*MOT: and Matthew was really cross and I learnt my lesson .
*MOT: I was thrown in jail for setting fire to somebodys house .
*CHI: that was cool .
*MOT: now that was a cool story wasnt it ?
*MOT: it wasnt the truth but it that was a much better version .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: this is why Thomas now whenever I do ironing .
*MOT: if you see me unplug the iron and I take it off the ironing board
*MOT: and I put the ironing board away so that I can think “ah yes I
*MOT: and I never leave a socket on the floor because theyre jolly
*MOT: dont play with those .
*MOT: you dont play with electricity .
*MOT: all youre doing now is putting the plug into the um other side
*MOT: you can pop it in there if you like then well hang it back on the
*CHI: no .
*MOT: dont put it into a socket  Thomas .
*MOT: you dont play with sockets .
*CHI: Im not going to .
*MOT: this is a curly cable isnt it ?
*MOT: it stretches .
*MOT: can you see ?
*MOT: is it like a hosepipe ?
*MOT: now this is the other thing .
*MOT: never let go because if you let go it will spring back .
*MOT: and it would hit me and that would hurt as well .
*MOT: you see if I if I let go of this this would hit your leg and
*CHI: what if I runned away ?
*MOT: no no no .
*CHI: if I runned away what would happen ?
*MOT: now if you ran away and let go it would come flying back and hit me
*MOT: and I know that wouldnt hurt you but I would be jolly cross .
*MOT: no  dont Thomas because if those little prongs get damaged .
*MOT: if they get bent .
*MOT: it wont go in the socket and then it wont work .
*MOT: right bring it back to me  please .
*CHI: bambamo .
*CHI: bangbangbango .
*MOT: no bring it back to me Thomas  please .
*CHI: Im just putting out the fire .
*CHI: pssto .
*CHI: and hose are here .
*MOT: I thought you would turn it into a hosepipe because its a bit like
*CHI: turn it into a curly cable .
*CHI: then here it is .
*CHI: big lectricc plug .
*CHI: pffto .
*CHI: shall the gas go to you ?
*MOT: are you pretending its a gas pipe now ?
*MOT: come on .
*MOT: I think you didnt you needta stop playing with it now .
*MOT: pass it to me .
*MOT: its going to get damaged .
*MOT: do you know why we use extension leads like this  Thomas ?
*CHI: no .
*MOT: because when Im doing things like the ironing .
*CHI: hm ?
*MOT: if I wanna iron and watch television .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: then I can put the ironing board up in the room so I can watch
*MOT: then the cord on the iron isnt long enough to reach the socket but
*MOT: that just extends the lead a little bit so I can put the iron plug
*CHI: hm .
*MOT: and this into the socket and it gives me all this extra electric
*MOT: so I can stand where I want and iron .
*MOT: and thats what we use those for and Daddy uses it when he goes in
*MOT: to put to put it into the socket so he can switch the light
*MOT: there .
*MOT: theyre quite useful things arent they ?
*CHI: there they are trucks .
*CHI: yesterday .
*MOT: trucks ?
*MOT: I thought you were talking about extension leads .
*MOT: are you talking about trucks ?
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: are you playing with some trucks now ?
*CHI: yep .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: can you pretend that this ones not a transporter ?
*MOT: alright .

*MOT: what is it ?
*CHI: its a delivery truck .
*MOT: a delivery truck .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: what sort of delivery truck ?
*CHI: it delivers parcels .
*CHI: lots this is an excavator .
*MOT: an excavator ?
*MOT: thats a big word .
*CHI: it levels the ground .
*MOT: does it ?
*CHI: ow .
*MOT: I think an excavator actually digs up the ground .
*MOT: to have a good look at whats underneath doesnt it ?
*MOT: right .
*MOT: Im going to put those little bits of pear that are left in a box .
*CHI: running them down the road>
*MOT: Ill pop it in this little red box then you can help yourself when
*CHI: now Ill know .
*CHI: then Ill know where it is .
*CHI: if its a pear or not .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: you certainly will .
*MOT: youll be able to see that for yourself wont you ?
*CHI: look it tells you the name of the truck .
*MOT: it does ?
*MOT: what does it say on it ?
*CHI: its a star .
*MOT: a star ?
*MOT: where ?
*MOT: where then ?
*CHI: look .

*CHI: I dont .
*CHI: can I just make it open ?
*CHI: open .
*MOT: is it ?
*MOT: right .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: um .
*CHI: its quite difficult isnt it ?
*MOT: oh look .
*MOT: first thing I come to .
*MOT: that was lucky wasnt it ?
*CHI: yep .
*CHI: because I put them there because I thought someone might want
*MOT: did you ?
*MOT: did you think somebody would come in and ask you to buy some ?
*CHI: mhm .
*CHI: pretend you have Thomas will you ?
*CHI: uh T uh you say would
*MOT: youre doing what the post office lady did last night arent you
*CHI: would you like to see in it ?
*MOT: yes please .
*CHI: okay .
*CHI: come here .
*MOT: oh wow .
*CHI: because Ive emptied all those letters .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: now what did she
*CHI: into here .
*MOT: what did she have with her ?
*CHI: a scan .
*MOT: a scanner ?
*CHI: scanned it from there .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: you scan it like she scanned .
*CHI: scan .
*MOT: scan .
*MOT: and where did she say you scanned it ?
*CHI: forgot .
*MOT: well its so that (.)
*CHI: the cant  come in .
*MOT: so what  love ?
*CHI: um if robbers have got the keys then then they'll
*MOT: well .
*MOT: she had a really really huge bunch of keys didnt she ?
*MOT: and she said theres a different key for every letter box .
*MOT: because then if the keys are stolen .
*MOT: it would take somebody a long long time to work out which key
*MOT: and they could probably set up a trap and catch them .
*MOT: whereas if one key opened all the boxes .
*MOT: then the person finding the key could whiz round all over opening
*MOT: and the reason she scanned it was because she cant say to her boss
*MOT: I emptied the post box on Chivington Drive .
*MOT: if she didnt because that when she scans it it transfers a
*MOT: but also its checking the time she empties it .
*MOT: because you know how when she opened it .
*MOT: on the scanner thing .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: there was a little message and it said “dont forget to change the
*MOT: well .
*MOT: the tag is is that little um disc that says one .
*MOT: two or three collections .
*MOT: do you know the one we mean ?
*MOT: when we look to see which number .
*CHI: can I just go in my little freezer uh where I keep bananas ?
*MOT: ooh .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: you dont keep freezers bananas in the freezer .
*MOT: and  when those numbers are up .
*MOT: one .
*MOT: two and three .
*MOT: it tells you the last time the post has been collected .
*MOT: so I think for us .
*MOT: here .
*MOT: if number ones up .
*MOT: it means the post is collected at something like seven oclock in
*MOT: if number two is up .
*MOT: its collected at quarter past eleven in the morning .
*MOT: if number three is up .
*MOT: its collected at quarter to six at night .
*MOT: and so  if she tries to collect it before quarter to six .
*MOT: and somebody posts letters at quarter to six .
*MOT: theyre going to be really really really cross if shes already
*MOT: so it also checks that shes not emptying the box too early .
*MOT: because wed be really annoyed wouldnt we ?
*MOT: if we had a birthday card for your friend .
*MOT: and we went to the box .
*CHI: and it was my birthday .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: yes and it and if somebody thought rightq .
*MOT: well post Thomas a card now .
*MOT: thatll get there in the morning .
*MOT: and when they got to the post box the post had already been

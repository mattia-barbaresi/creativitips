*MOT: and they perhaps had bread I cant remember .
*CHI: could you see any fire extinguishers .
*MOT: well I dont think I really looked when I was a little girl .
*MOT: it probably did have .
*MOT: and in that little village there was Mummys school .
*MOT: oh did you see all those birds fly across .
*MOT: but the nearest proper town was nearly three miles away and thats .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: and so because we didnt go to the town everyday which was .
*MOT: there wasnt a very good bus service .
*MOT: Nana useta buy her bread from a little van that useta come round .
*MOT: it was a Sunblest van and he useta come on Tuesdays and Thursdays .
*MOT: and he useta come about two three oclock in the afternoon and .
*MOT: and all the ladys like Nana Bealby would have a little basket ready .
*MOT: and I had a little basket all of my own .
*MOT: Ill show you .
*MOT: its upstairs .
*MOT: and we useta buy bread and cakes and biscuits and they also .
*CHI: Mummy did you lost .
*CHI: um did you .

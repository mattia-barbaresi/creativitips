*MOT: sausages coming down from the sky and .
*MOT: it doesnt seem right .
*CHI: a fire engine flying .
*CHI: up comes the fire engine .
*CHI: must be on top gear when it flies .
*MOT: well Ive never seen a fire engine fly .
*MOT: Ive seen sometimes .
*MOT: television pictures of when theres .
*MOT: say a bad forest fire .
*CHI: aeroplanes sweep very low .
*MOT: and shoot water out dont they .
*MOT: they jet water down .
*CHI: yep .
*MOT: but Ive never seen a fire engine .
*MOT: swinging in the sky like that .
*CHI: wocho look where its landing .
*CHI: its landing at the sausage factory .
*MOT: 0 .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: is there actually a fire at the sausage factory .
*MOT: or is it just putting the oven out .
*CHI: just putting the oven out .
*MOT: well surely it would be better just to .
*MOT: turn the oven off wouldnt it .
*MOT: and let it cool down .
*MOT: you really need the fire brigade to come out .
*CHI: yep .
*CHI: its very hard to put out with water .
*CHI: very hard to put out with .
*CHI: our water .
*CHI: but not the fire brigades .
*MOT: so does this happen every single day .
*MOT: that the foot sausage factorys working .
*CHI: yes and every time its nearly finished .
*CHI: a fire engine swoops down .
*MOT: but what happens if theres a cat stuck up a tree .
*MOT: or an accident or a proper fire .
*MOT: and the fire engines busy putting your .
*MOT: oven out .
*MOT: is that not dangerous .
*CHI: never had two fire engines that swooped down .
*CHI: we have nine fire engines that swoop down on our house .
*MOT: well that must be very expensive .
*MOT: but what I was meaning was if .
*MOT: if there was a house fire .
*MOT: and you needed the fire in an emergency and they .
*MOT: they said “oh sorry the fire engines busy” .
*MOT: putting the oven out .
*MOT: and somebody could be hurt .
*MOT: while the fire engines busy .
*CHI: fire engines .
*CHI: thats here .
*MOT: you seem to be having more and more fire engines .
*CHI: thats why everybody .
*CHI: uhoh Ive got a problem putting this down .
*MOT: the ladders .
*MOT: just gently dont break it Thomas .
*CHI: I think Ive already broke .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: pass it to me .
*MOT: just do it gently .
*CHI: oh its coming off .
*MOT: well dont .
*MOT: thats it .
*MOT: thats it .
*MOT: just very gently .
*MOT: slide it back in .
*MOT: because this is the only fire engine with .
*MOT: ladders that works now isnt it .
*CHI: hope this is not the same .
*MOT: well would you like to pass it to me Thomas .
*MOT: and well sort it out .
*MOT: rather than forcing .
*CHI: neowo .
*CHI: 0 .

*MOT: those toy fire engine ladders .
*CHI: a real firemans ladders are really stable .
*MOT: oh well they hafta dont they .
*MOT: at least I would hope they would be .
*MOT: this this does seem to happen with all yours .
*MOT: and I dont quite understand what the problem is .
*CHI: is maybe because toys .
*MOT: they dont hate being your toys .
*CHI: coming .
*MOT: there you are fixed .
*CHI: kicho kocho kicho kocho .
*CHI: next time I will be at work this time .
*MOT: perhaps the poor ladders are worn out if they .
*MOT: hafta keep putting the oven out in your factory .
*CHI: mhm .
*CHI: they go in fast reversing .
*MOT: could or imagine ordinary fire engines proper fire engines .
*MOT: wouldnt hafta use the ladders every time .
*MOT: because some fires that they go to .
*MOT: they wouldnt needta use ladders .
*CHI: they do at my sage .
*MOT: yes but thats what I mean if they hafta .
*MOT: put the ladders up to put your fire out .
*MOT: every single day .
*MOT: poor ladders are probably worn out .

*CHI: that green light .
*MOT: oh good .
*CHI: and that green light .
*MOT: good .
*MOT: well thats the microphone .
*MOT: so we need those lights on dont we .

*MOT: so we hafta keep looking dont we .
*MOT: to check that the green light is on .
*CHI: its on ap orange light .
*CHI: and red light .
*MOT: well yes .
*MOT: when we look at the actual piece of equipment the orange light .
*CHI: comes on .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: it comes on .
*MOT: it means that its plugged into the electricity .
*MOT: and when the green lights come on it means that the batterys are .
*MOT: is on it means .
*MOT: so weve got to look at the red light on the machine .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: the green light on these two microphones .
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: and then on the monitors weve got to check theres a green and a .
*MOT: so thats five lights weve got to look for .
*MOT: and the other day what happened .

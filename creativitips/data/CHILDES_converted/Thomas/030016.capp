*MOT: when they saw Missus coming along with her gardening basket and her .
*MOT: ha shes coming to pull out the weeds .

*MOT: and stood them on a window sill .
*MOT: and they did look very nice in vase but they stood inside looking .
*MOT: and once you cut flowers Thomas .
*MOT: and bring them inside the house they dont last as long as they do .
*MOT: and now all they could do was look out at the dandelions who were .
*MOT: and so the lilys might have thought the dandelions were weeds but .

*MOT: I dont know whether it says Sainsburysq .
*MOT: but its a blue tshirt .
*MOT: with an orange logo on it .
*MOT: its not ours .
*MOT: its on somebody elses washing line isnt it .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: we have a lot of slugs but the thing is I think the difference is .
*MOT: a lot fall down between her picking them up .
*MOT: and so the slugs get on the ground .
*MOT: I dont think anybody would necessarily climb up to the tree .
*MOT: wasps might like apples but I think uh .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: there are wasps around at the moment arent they .
*CHI: there are and theyre big .

*MOT: Annie Apple .

*CHI: is that what well only have .
*MOT: then my legs might drop off .
*CHI: pardon .
*MOT: then my legs might drop off .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: if Ive got a soggy bottom .
*MOT: my legs wouldnt be able to hold on to anything .
*CHI: Mum .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: Gwens got a bigger bottom than you .
*MOT: who has .
*CHI: Gwen .
*MOT: Gwen .
*CHI: yep .
*MOT: oh now Thomas .
*MOT: dont say that .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: its not nice to make comments about peoples shape .
*MOT: or size .
*CHI: a bottom of lies .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: but its not nice Thomas .
*MOT: because I dont mind it doesnt matter who you are .
*MOT: theres usually something about you youd like to change if you .
*MOT: you know .
*MOT: the color of your hair .
*MOT: the shape of your nose .
*MOT: your size .
*MOT: and you cant .
*MOT: its just the way we are .
*MOT: were all different .
*MOT: and some people are bigger than others .
*MOT: and its not kind when you start making comments because a lot of .
*MOT: I mean Id like to look a lot slimmer .
*MOT: I wish my hair wasnt as grey .
*MOT: I wish lots of things .
*MOT: but no .
*MOT: thats the way we are .
*CHI: I I wish um the house was made of sweets but .
*MOT: 0 .
*MOT: ooh .
*MOT: there you are .
*MOT: you see .
*MOT: just make do with what youve got .
*MOT: well you dont hafta make do .
*MOT: youve got to make the most of it .
*MOT: its like that lady said to me in Marks and Spencers the other day .
*CHI: what .
*MOT: when I was buying something .
*MOT: I said to her that it made me realize how big Id got because a .
*MOT: they would look really nice on somebody like Thomas .
*MOT: you know .
*MOT: somebody tall and slim .
*MOT: somebody tall .
*MOT: sit up properly .
*MOT: tall and slim and young .
*MOT: and I said to her it makes me realize how Ive changed .
*MOT: because I just wouldnt be able to fit into things like that any .
*MOT: and she said all you do Madam is buy it in a bigger size and wear .
*MOT: there you are .
*MOT: and she was more or less saying it doesnt matter .
*MOT: as long as you feel good in it you dont care what other people .
*MOT: and its true .
*MOT: when you look around you see all sorts of different people .
*MOT: but you know at the end of the day Thomas .
*MOT: were very lucky that we can see .
*MOT: that we can hear .
*MOT: that were not poorly .
*MOT: that we can run around .
*MOT: I mean look at the way you run around .
*MOT: and ride your bike and things and some children cant walk .
*MOT: some children are in hospital because theyre poorly .
*MOT: some are starving with no food .
*MOT: I mean yes .
*MOT: you know .
*MOT: you might want a few things but when you think about it youre .
*MOT: youve got a nice roof over your head .
*MOT: youre warm and snug at night and youve got plenty to eat .
*MOT: and when youre poorly weve got medicine and that really is all .
*CHI: Mum .
*MOT: and youve got friends .
*CHI: Mum .
*CHI: when the poor people wake up and say .
*CHI: Mum can I have some breakfast .
*CHI: say whats for breakfast .
*CHI: nothing .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: you see they probably get to the stage where they dont even ask .
*MOT: because they just know theres no food .
*MOT: you imagine that .
*MOT: you know when you feel a little bit peckish and your tummy starts .
*MOT: you imagine going for days and days and days without food and .
*MOT: or when you do drink water .
*MOT: sometimes it can make you poorly because its not clean .
*MOT: I mean I know there are a lot of children have more toys than you .
*MOT: they have a bigger house than you .
*CHI: oh .
*MOT: they maybe go on on big holidays and things which we dont do .
*MOT: at the end of the day .
*MOT: the most important things in life are what youve got .
*MOT: and a lot of children dont have any of those .
*MOT: a lot of children have fancy cars and big houses .
*MOT: and lots of toys but their mum and dads dont love them .
*MOT: nobody could love people more than you .
*MOT: I didnt say that right .
*MOT: more nobody could be loved more than you is what I mean .
*MOT: Mummy couldnt love anybody more than she loves you .
*MOT: and thats very important .
*MOT: I know I get cross with you .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: but at the end of the day youre my precious little boy .
*MOT: and Id do anything for you .
*MOT: you know that dont you .
*MOT: laughs .
*MOT: oh dear .
*MOT: what made you think of a donkey when I went through all that .
*CHI: laughs .
*MOT: laughs .
*MOT: not only you but Purdie is a lucky cat .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: why .
*MOT: most cats are not pampered like Purdie is .
*CHI: pampered .
*CHI: what 0does pamper mean .
*MOT: pampered means spoilt to death Thomas .
*CHI: laughs .
*MOT: Im sure it doesnt quite mean spoilt to death .
*MOT: but she is .
*MOT: not many cats live to be nineteen .
*MOT: and shes got there because shes absolutely spoilt to death .
*CHI: laughs .
*CHI: I know why .
*CHI: ah .
*CHI: meow .
*MOT: because Mummy loves her as well .
*CHI: I shout down her ear .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: shouting down her ear is not nice .
*MOT: but she cant really hear a lot can she now .
*MOT: she still knows we love .
*MOT: because we still feed her and we cuddle her and stroke her and .
*MOT: and shes got a nice clean bed and we let her go in the sun .
*MOT: and we let her in and out when she wants .
*MOT: and Purdies got everything .
*CHI: we let her have cat food when she wants .
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: and a lot of pussycats dont have food .
*MOT: and they hafta go outside and catch mice .
*MOT: and birds and anything thats hanging around .
*MOT: mind you .
*MOT: in fairness Purdie was a stray cat when we got her .
*MOT: she didnt have a nice life .
*MOT: when I got her she was very injured .
*MOT: very poorly .
*MOT: she was badly injured .
*MOT: she was hungry .
*MOT: she was covered in fleas .
*MOT: she was a real mess .
*MOT: I think she was frightened .
*MOT: because she was frightened to death of the noise of water .
*MOT: and she was frightened of ladies .
*MOT: she didnt mind men but she didnt like ladies .
*MOT: didnt like me .
*MOT: ooh no .
*CHI: did she like me .
*MOT: dont know .
*MOT: she didnt seem to like anybody and look at her now .
*MOT: all these years later .
*MOT: and thats because weve given her love .
*MOT: havent we .
*CHI: and careness .
*MOT: kindness .
*CHI: careness .
*MOT: kindness .
*MOT: weve cared for her .
*CHI: yum yum .
*MOT: piece of toast .
*MOT: there you are .
*MOT: have you finished your cereal .
*CHI: dessert .
*MOT: dessert .
*MOT: its a piece of toast with orange marmalade on it .
*CHI: with no carrot .
*MOT: well its not carrot .
*MOT: its finely shredded orange peel isnt it .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: it looks like a .
*MOT: oh theres no margarine on that darling .
*MOT: did you want margarine on it .
*CHI: sweeter .
*MOT: because I dont have margarine on my toast .
*MOT: I just put marmalade on it .
*MOT: but because I was talking to you I didnt eat it up .
*MOT: and you pinched it .
*MOT: I think the other thing is Thomas .
*MOT: you never really know what happens .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: dont you do that .
*MOT: you dont actually know what happens to people .
*MOT: which is why you should always be very kind to people .
*MOT: because sometimes even though people put on a brave face .
*MOT: maybe at nursery or even at school .
*MOT: or on the bus .
*MOT: or in the street .
*MOT: do you see people and theyre nice and chatty or very cheerful .
*MOT: but sometimes .
*MOT: do you remember that lady in Marks and Spencers who spoke to us .
*MOT: when we were having a meal .
*MOT: and she came up to me and Daddy and said .
*MOT: ooh you are lucky to have a baby .
*MOT: I mean she was an elderly lady and she said .
*MOT: I could I could never have children .
*MOT: and I dont think theyd give me one now when Im seventy .
*MOT: and do you know .
*MOT: she chatted to us and perhaps were the only people that she spoke .
*MOT: and shes obviously very sad sometimes .
*MOT: but she was nice and pleasant when we met her .
*MOT: and this is it .
*MOT: you never actually know what a lot of people .
*CHI: Im that monkey .
*MOT: whos that monkey .
*MOT: oh yes .
*MOT: thats the box we brought back from Marks and Spencers .
*CHI: I am the monkey .
*MOT: you know sometimes you never know what people .
*MOT: whats happening to people at home .
*MOT: you know .
*MOT: they might not be very happy when they get home sometimes .
*MOT: so you always try and be nice to people .
*MOT: because even if people havent got a lot of toys .
*MOT: or sometimes at home people dont love them .
*MOT: or sometimes theyre a little bit hungry or cold .
*MOT: you can always be pleasant to people and nice to them cant you ?
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: yes .
*CHI: yep .
*MOT: that doesnt cost anything to be nice to people does it .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: Ive just got to go and flip the button on the machine through here .
*CHI: heres one of our friends .
*MOT: there we are .
*CHI: heres one of our friends .
*MOT: now heres our friend .
*MOT: uh .
*MOT: hello pussycat .
*CHI: mimiouwo .
*CHI: miouwo .
*CHI: miouwo .
*CHI: miouwo miouwo .
*CHI: miouwo .
*MOT: and you see Purdies so spoilt Thomas .
*MOT: that even though shes got some food left from last night .
*MOT: she wont eat it .
*MOT: because shes a snobby pussycat .
*CHI: fresh .
*MOT: she likes fresh .
*MOT: but what we do .
*MOT: we trick her a little bit .
*MOT: because this food from last night is perfectly alright .
*MOT: if its dried up .
*MOT: which happens sometimes if its a very hot day .
*MOT: I wouldnt give it to her .
*MOT: but this hasnt dried .
*MOT: so what I do is scrape it onto a fresh plate .
*MOT: mix it with a little bit of fresh .
*MOT: and shes none the wiser .
*MOT: she is sometimes though .
*MOT: she realizes sometimes and thats when we hafta put in the crunchy .
*MOT: did you have a nice time outside Puss .
*MOT: did you have a nice time .
*MOT: did you have a nice time .
*MOT: oh shes not going to talk to us Tom today .
*CHI: oh .
*MOT: oops a daisy .
*MOT: there you are .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: theres your breakfast .
*MOT: there you are .
*MOT: you see .
*MOT: shes not noticed .
*MOT: thats clever isnt it .
*MOT: thats a clever trick .
*MOT: laughs .
*MOT: well its too expensive .
*MOT: oops .
*MOT: its one puss that just fell over .
*MOT: thats too expensive to throw away .
*MOT: I mean its only a little bit but uh you cant waste food like .
*MOT: are you likely to want more toast Thomas after that .
*CHI: likely .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: likely no .
*MOT: 0 .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: this is my first piece .
*MOT: so Ill put another piece in for myself .
*MOT: but if youd like it .
*MOT: you can have it .
*MOT: now just while were talking about things like that Thomas .
*MOT: I know there are times when I get cross .
*MOT: and when I shout and when you think Im being mean .
*MOT: but you know just think on .
*MOT: that we all have days when things dont go quite right .
*MOT: or we cant have what we want .
*MOT: but at the end of the day weve still got an awful lot more things .
*MOT: havent we .
*MOT: oops a daisy .
*MOT: what would you like .
*MOT: if you could have anything in the world .
*MOT: what would you like .
*CHI: hallelujah .
*MOT: 0 .
*CHI: live next to a trump factory .
*MOT: next to a what factory .
*CHI: trump one .
*MOT: Thomas dont be silly .
*MOT: thats rude .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: I dont think they have trump factorys Thomas .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: 0 .
*MOT: do you .
*MOT: I tell you what .
*MOT: it would be a bit whiffy .
*CHI: oh .
*MOT: you know when you see big chimneys coming out of factories .
*CHI: mhm .
*MOT: just imagine what would be coming out of the top of that .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: not smoke but smells .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: Im almost late for my next break time .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I wouldnt like that .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: got an important visitor Mum .
*CHI: they go there .
*MOT: mhm .
*CHI: oh dear dear .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I cant imagine an important visitor wanting to go to a trump .
*CHI: 0 .
*CHI: we not go .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: oh Purdies having a little sneeze .
*MOT: have you noticed she does this after shes eaten now .
*MOT: licking her big whiskers .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: you know why cats have whiskers Thomas dont you .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: well they can feel with them .
*MOT: theyre very sensitive .
*MOT: and whiskers are as wide as Purdies body .
*MOT: and what it means if she was going through a hole .
*MOT: if she was going into something .
*MOT: and her whiskers touched the edges .
*MOT: she would think uhoh .
*MOT: Im going to get stuck .
*MOT: because if my whiskers dont wont go through my fat bits .
*MOT: come on Puss .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: now .
*MOT: off you go .
*MOT: bye bye .
*MOT: bye Puss .
*MOT: 0 .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: and they have them on the top of the head for the height as well .
*MOT: for the same reason .
*MOT: and do you know what Grandad Bilbey did when he was a little boy ?
*MOT: this was very very cruel .
*MOT: he cut his pussycats whiskers off .
*CHI: laughs .
*MOT: and that was cruel .
*MOT: that was dangerous .
*MOT: but his pussycat could then of gone and got stuck in a hole .

*MOT: watches tv .
*INV: theres quite good tv in the mornings isnt there ?
*INV: Patrick would be an early riser too as well .
*INV: he goes and wakes Rob .
*INV: but I dont think he has very good patience .
*INV: are you going to see how your mother is ?
*INV: do you wanna ?
*INV: do you wanna ?
*INV: do you wanna be the doctor for your mother ?
*INV: what you do is hang it round you like that .
*INV: and walk around  like that .
*MOT: do you ever see doctors in Casualty with one of them on Rachel ?
*INV: yes like that  you see .
*INV: just hang it round you like that .
*MOT: just like the doctors in Casualty do dont they ?
*INV: I havent tried that .
*INV: but sometimes you can actually
*INV: these ones do work .
*INV: you can listen to your heart .
*INV: you can put that in your ears  like that .
*INV: can you hear anything ?
*INV: Patrick got a doctors kit just going into hospital .
*MOT: right .
*INV: I got it for him a few years ago .
*INV: he got a doctors kit for Christmas .
*INV: and he could do everything
*MOT: is that right ?
*INV: he was taking my blood pressure  doing injections .
*INV: its amazing what they can pick up you know .
*INV: so will Peter take a fortnight off for the twelfth or +..?
*MOT: um I think he will probably just get the days really .
*MOT: he wouldnt take his holidays then .
*MOT: um we sort of hafta stay .
*MOT: because I want him to take Christmas to get a whole lot of
*MOT: because thats when the babys due .
*INV: Christmas oh !
*MOT: the seventeenth uhhuh .
*INV: oh really ?
*MOT: so he will hafta take time off work whenever I am actually in the
*MOT: then time off work when I come home you know ?
*MOT: so hell hafta save as much as possible until then .
*INV: so have you had a scan ?
*MOT: no just the first one .
*MOT: just the mini one .
*MOT: but I havent had the one where they give the photo out home yet .
*INV: oh do you get one ?
*MOT: yes you do .
*INV: oh do you ?
*MOT: yes .
*INV: oh we never got one .
*MOT: they give you a big scan and you can have a photo .
*INV: ah thats lovely .
*MOT: but yes I had one at twelve or eleven weeks last week .
*INV: yes yes so its really a thrill that you have a scan isnt it ?
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: I know it looks like a baby .
*MOT: yeah its exciting .
*MOT: yeah I really believe that theres only one there .
*MOT: because Peters daddys a twin .
*MOT: and I always thought you know with me being so sick .
*MOT: because you know a few times when I was even sicker with Rachel
*MOT: I thought +"/.
*MOT: oh no I hope its not twins .
*MOT: twins are lovely .
*MOT: but I wouldnt like to look after them .
*INV: right .
*MOT: I wouldnt even mind the first time .
*MOT: but definitely not when youve already got one .
*MOT: and youre only planning on having one more .
*INV: one of Patricks friends mum  um shes got two boys .
*INV: and shes expecting twins .
*INV: um shes only about eight weeks at the moment .
*INV: but shes been so ill .
*INV: she I mean she can do nothing .
*INV: and she is constantly feeling dreadful .
*MOT: I feel sorry for her .
*INV: at the same time shes glad .
*INV: because there was a five year gap between the youngest one .
*INV: and she says at least theyll be company for each other .
*MOT: yeah .
*INV: she says +"/.
*INV: I dont know how Im going to make it through .
*INV: ah .
*MOT: the first couple of months can be terrible .
*MOT: getting up to feed one baby in the night .
*INV: can I put a sticking plaster on you ?
*INV: have you got +..?
*CHI: yeah .
*INV: oh .
*INV: have you got a plaster on ?
*INV: are they good at the hospital here ?
*INV: theyre going to go down to
*MOT: the Ulster  yeah uhhuh its good .
*MOT: theyre nice .
*MOT: theyre really nice .
*INV: thats where you had Rachel ?
*MOT: yes .
*INV: do you have are any of the doctors or the midwives the same
*INV: or will they be different ?
*MOT: no no different .
*MOT: even when I went with Rachel the first time  you hardly got the
*INV: yeah .
*MOT: though youre under a particular consultant .
*MOT: but I dont think I dont think Ive ever seen him at all .
*INV: oh really ?
*MOT: um but this doctor I had this time was really really nice (.)
*MOT: I would really like to see him again .
*MOT: he was very good .
*INV: oh yeah yes !
*MOT: he reckons I had a Caesarean Section with Rachel .
*INV: did you  oh .
*MOT: because she was breach .
*MOT: eh though he reckons I have a seventy five to eighty per cent
*INV: oh great .
*MOT: because it was just a Caesarean Section .
*MOT: though Im wondering .
*MOT: because she was lying in a really funny position .
*MOT: I mean they couldnt tell .
*MOT: but those nurses must be able to tell if its breach just by
*INV: yes yes !
*MOT: but every time they felt my stomach they said Im not convinced
*MOT: and they actually hadta give me a scan the morning of the section
*MOT: yeah so I dont think it was actually breach .
*MOT: I think it might have been transferred to lying across that way .
*MOT: so Im wondering if it was anything to do with the shape of my womb
*MOT: because she was never in the proper position .
*MOT: but they said in the hospital that they didnt know that they'd
*MOT: and just aim for a normal delivery .
*MOT: and see what happens from now to then .
*INV: yes .
*MOT: I thought maybe when they did the section maybe they would have
*MOT: but theyd sort of indicated it was my womb .
*INV: yeah .
*INV: but then theres lots of people who do have a breach and then have
*MOT: och thats right .
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: I know it might just have been a fluke .
*INV: yeah .
*MOT: it probably was .
*MOT: but just a just a that she was in a weird position .
*MOT: I just wondered .
*INV: yeah yeah .
*INV: well does that did that mean that they planned you a
*MOT: you didnt hafta .
*MOT: yes it was planned no ?
*MOT: well they were waiting until I went into labor .
*MOT: but I didnt go into labor for .
*MOT: um they were leaving me for a week to see if I would go into
*MOT: but I didnt go into labor even then .
*MOT: so they just .
*MOT: I was so petrified .
*MOT: they felt sorry for me .
*MOT: so they said theyd leave me until I went into labor .
*INV: did you have a anaesthetic or a +..?
*MOT: yes yes .
*INV: I think Id want that too .
*MOT: now I dont think I would do that the next time .
*INV: wouldnt you ?
*MOT: it was horrible going under .
*INV: was it ?
*MOT: you see I thought Id had an operation a couple of years ago
*MOT: and they give you a premed and
*INV: yes .
*MOT: you were sort of happy as Larry .
*MOT: you dont care what happens you .
*MOT: and it really relaxes you .
*MOT: and then they just give you a wee injection in your hand .
*MOT: and youre away to sleep .
*MOT: but the section was different .
*MOT: you were going to the theater without any premed .
*INV: oh no .
*MOT: and you were actually in the theater without any premed .
*MOT: it was terrible .
*MOT: I hadta close my eyes the whole time .
*MOT: and even when they were talking to me  I was still .
*MOT: they were saying to me +"/.
*MOT: are you okay ?
*MOT: and I shaked my head .
*MOT: I couldnt open my eyes and see everyone with their
*INV: ah .
*MOT: and then when they do put .
*MOT: now I read beforehand about having a section .
*MOT: and it says they hafta pump oxygen into your stomach to get it to
*INV: really ?
*MOT: it sounds awful .
*MOT: you imagine the size of a balloon away up to here .
*INV: I dont believe it .
*MOT: what actually happens once you breathe suddenly in and it might
*MOT: because you dont notice it .
*INV: ah .
*MOT: you dont even notice youre breathing in the oxygen .
*MOT: but then they changed the .
*MOT: and then youre breathing in whatevers putting you to sleep and
*INV: ah ah .
*MOT: and you feel your whole body going numb
*INV: ah .
*MOT: and the last thing I felt going numb was my mouth
*INV: oh no .
*MOT: and then you just seen the blackness .
*MOT: oh that was horrible !
*INV: oh no !
*MOT: thats why I wouldnt go under that anaesthetic again .
*INV: horrid !
*MOT: it was horrible .
*MOT: it really was .
*INV: and what about Peter did he +..?
*MOT: he he waited in a room there .
*INV: oh yes .
*MOT: next door because they dont let you in if theyre doing a general
*MOT: so if I had of had the epidural block
*INV: yes .
*MOT: he could of come in .
*INV: yes .
*MOT: so I says if I did hafta have a Caesarean the next time I would go
*INV: yeah yes .
*MOT: because um I mean youre not giddy or anything when you come
*INV: yes yes .
*MOT: you know ?
*INV: yeah .
*MOT: apparently you can feel a bit of wetness when the water breaks and
*MOT: my cousin said it felt like someone was washing their hands in her
*INV: thats disgusting !
*MOT: but she was .
*MOT: and they usually have that was breach .
*MOT: and up to the last minute they didnt know .
*INV: right .
*MOT: and then they said it was maybe alright .
*MOT: and they tried turning
*INV: oh did they ?
*MOT: they tried turning .
*MOT: apparently they dont do that now
*MOT: but they says because I was Rhesus negative that they dont do that
*INV: oh gosh .
*MOT: and the baby was positive so that the blood crosses or something
*INV: does it mean that youd hafta have a transfusion or anything
*MOT: no its um ah an injection of um Anti D  whatever that is ,
*MOT: that was to protect subsequent babies .
*INV: oh .
*INV: oh right gosh  are you going to be a doctor ?
*INV: do you like that ?
*INV: does she come along with you too when you go ?
*MOT: she did the last time .
*MOT: but its too long to wait .
*MOT: but she will come the next time when were actually seeing the scan
*INV: it will be such a long wait for her until the baby comes .
*INV: its its difficult to know isnt it ?
*INV: youre very tidy .
*INV: you put everything away .
*INV: thats what I like to see .
*INV: I wish my boys would do that .
*MOT: youre very quiet today Flossy .
*INV: although my cousin  she had two babies subsequently with normal
*MOT: did she Rose ?
*INV: even though she had a section .
*MOT: you see I thought it was a good idea have a section this time .
*MOT: because I was petrified of going through the birth thing .
*MOT: so I thought +"/.
*MOT: och Ive had an operation before .
*MOT: and it was no problem .
*MOT: and I get over operations really quickly .
*MOT: and I thought this would have been quite a good idea .
*MOT: because even the doctor in hospital says to me +"/.
*MOT: with a bit of luck it might turn .
*MOT: but I says +"/.
*MOT: no Im hoping it doesnt .
*MOT: I wanna have a section .
*INV: ah .
*MOT: I think he thought I was crazy .
*MOT: but they I knew why afterwards .
*MOT: like you were really just afterwards really .
*MOT: it was awful .
*MOT: especially when everyone else was getting out of bed .
*MOT: and I hadta lie in bed for .
*MOT: well I mean I could get out to go down for meals .
*MOT: but I couldnt really jump out and feed and change Rachel for a
*INV: yes yes .
*MOT: I hadta get  the nurses to come and do that .
*MOT: and with your first baby its a bit of a shock after about the
*INV: ah .
*MOT: your first attempt at trying to change a nappie after about three
*INV: oh dear yes yes !
*INV: well was she quite easy earlier on ?
*MOT: what ?
*INV: was Rachel quite easy earlier on ?
*MOT: naw she was a terrible baby she was .
*MOT: I called her a live wire .
*MOT: I didnt wanna say she was a terrible baby .
*MOT: a live wire seemed appropriate enough .
*CHI: wheres the scissors again ?
*MOT: she did nothing but cry for the first couple of months .
*INV: oh gosh yes .
*MOT: no matter what I did though .
*MOT: I really dont think there was anything the matter with her .
*MOT: I think she would have been like that no matter what
*INV: yeah yes .
*MOT: because my mum tried to tell me that she wasnt getting enough food
*MOT: because I was breast feeding her .
*INV: oh yes .
*MOT: not getting enough food .
*MOT: and my aunt tried to tell me she had colic .
*MOT: I knew instinctively that she didnt .
*MOT: because she always burped herself even
*INV: yeah .
*MOT: even when I lifted her up you know ?
*INV: yeah yeah .
*INV: do you want that ?
*INV: theres the girl .
*INV: yes Rob cried and cried for about three months and I tried
*MOT: it really wears you down doesnt it ?
*INV: yeah .
*INV: who lives next door she just had a heart attack .
*INV: I mean it was always great .
*MOT: because she was always sitting there not able to do anything .
*MOT: so I could just give it
*MOT: so she could nurse him .
*INV: yeah yeah .
*MOT: well that's
*INV: and she would say +"/.
*INV: I think hes not .
*INV: and I would feel .
*INV: and then you feel guilty you know ?
*MOT: too .
*MOT: she did just wanna be nursed the whole time .
*INV: yeah .
*MOT: really .
*MOT: and when I put her down at all it was terrible .
*MOT: and then I says +"/.
*MOT: me Im going to get one of those slings to use around the
*INV: great .
*MOT: at least maybe you could get the dishes done  make the beds .
*MOT: but maybe this one will not need that .
*INV: yes .
*MOT: I didnt actually have one with Rachel .
*MOT: by the time I sort of thought about it it was you know (.)
*MOT: so I says I would get one of those .
*MOT: and another thing that I could have did with was something that
*INV: ach yes .
*MOT: because I spent ages rocking her down .
*INV: ah .
*CHI: mum mum mum .
*MOT: wait to see where they go Rachel .
*MOT: I think that pair goes in there .
*INV: I wonder why theres two scissors there .
*INV: what do you think thats for ?
*INV: and whats that for ?
*CHI: I dont know .
*INV: does your mum ever take your temperature ?
*MOT: mummie puts a wee thing on your head to take your temperature
*MOT: oh of course  yes thats right .
*MOT: Ive never had those .
*MOT: they seem to be okay .
*INV: thats much simpler isnt it ?
*MOT: uhhuh .
*INV: I just useta do it under their arms .
*INV: and you know you can usually just feel just from them cant you ?
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: sometimes I know you really just use it to confirm it dont you ?
*MOT: or just to see how high it is .
*CHI: 0 .
*MOT: I think we need your hair cut again Rachel .
*INV: its getting lovelier .
*MOT: it looks very long .
*INV: do you like long hair ?

*MOT: well thats okay .
*INV: and how about the driving ?
*MOT: well I was actually sposta do my test tomorrow .

*MOT: because it was before the first of July you know when the theory
*INV: oh thats coming in so soon ?
*MOT: uhhuh she then I thought about it .
*MOT: and I thought +"/.
*MOT: oh no !
*MOT: I was so ill last week .
*MOT: Thursday and Friday was really bad .
*MOT: I just couldnt face it .
*MOT: so I canceled it .
*MOT: and hopefully my feell get returned to me .
*MOT: so I thought it would be better canceling it than sort of throwing
*MOT: so I knew I wasn't
*INV: oh yes .
*MOT: up to scratch .
*MOT: so Ill just leave it for a couple of months
*INV: yes yes .
*MOT: until I get enthusiastic about it again .

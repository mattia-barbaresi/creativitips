*CHI: laughs .
*INV: why ?
*MOT: I just think girls look nicer in pink .
*MOT: because once they get to a certain age I dont mind .
*MOT: but baby girls I prefer than baby boys .
*MOT: I mean once theyre toddlers boys are lovely as well but .
*INV: they always say youre better starting with a girl too .
*INV: because theyre more sensible .
*INV: and they they dress sort of .
*INV: we did it wrong .
*MOT: I think girls are quite .
*MOT: well my friends got two boys and a girl .
*MOT: you know the boys are about three and five .
*MOT: and the girls about a year and a half .
*MOT: and she is so good just as good as gold .
*MOT: and the two boys are mad mad .
*MOT: but theyre just different arent they ?
*INV: I know I would never have believed the difference there is .
*MOT: I know .
*INV: but having .
*MOT: my friend across the road shes got a wee boy whos about a .
*MOT: and shes due her second baby next week .
*INV: uhhuh .
*MOT: and hes hes pretty wild .
*MOT: you know I kept saying once he gets over a year hell be okay .
*INV: yes and then it just gets worse instead of it .
*MOT: and then we say probably once he gets to two hell be okay .
*INV: well thats the thing .
*INV: I mean basically you have .
*INV: I mean I was .
*MOT: shes yeah shes very good .
*MOT: shes no trouble at all .
*INV: well Ive got a little girl this week .
*INV: Patricks got a wee friend staying with him .
*MOT: oh has he ?
*INV: hes friends up in Ballycastle .
*INV: so weve got a girl in the house .
*MOT: I know .
*MOT: thats the way I feel as well .
*MOT: I dont think Ill know what to do with a boy .
*MOT: you know not know sort of what things hed be interested in .
*MOT: even boys toys are a bit boring as well like arent they ?
*INV: well Robert our middle one is really into Action Man at the .
*INV: and Thomas really winds him up and says .
*INV: oh its just hes into dolls .
*MOT: laughs .
*INV: and hes just the same really because I mean its all guns and .
*MOT: they all sound really macho .
*INV: but hes hes eight .
*INV: and he still sucks his thumb .
*INV: and so he took a bribe on over the summer .
*INV: so he got so many points each day that he didnt suck his thumb .
*INV: anyway he got enough points to get an Action Man .
*MOT: oh thats great .
*INV: so he spent all last week trying to decide which one he was going .
*INV: he kept looking to go to the shop .
*INV: but at least hes stopped sucking his thumb .
*INV: because hes getting to the age really .
*INV: you know its really affected his big teeth .
*MOT: I know yeah I know .
*MOT: well I mean when Rachel was born she wouldnt take a dummy .
*MOT: and I tried to give her a dummy .
*MOT: but she didnt want it .
*MOT: but she was getting to the stage where she was sucking her thumb .
*MOT: so then I tried her with the dummy again when she was about four .
*MOT: and she took it then .
*INV: yes oh thats .
*MOT: and then she became really addicted .
*INV: would she still take the dummy ?
*MOT: no no no .
*MOT: and she came off it so easily .
*MOT: I mean I thought she so addicted to it that would .
*INV: yeah yeah .
*MOT: but it wasnt .
*MOT: she just lost it one day .
*MOT: and normally I would have went out straight out and got her another .
*MOT: um but I says .
*MOT: no Ill try her in bed tonight without it and see how it goes .
*MOT: and she never asked for it .
*INV: is that right ?
*MOT: so I says .
*MOT: she didnt ask for it last night .
*MOT: so shell not you know .
*INV: thats fantastic isnt it ?
*MOT: so just after that it was just occasionally maybe if she .
*MOT: she would have woken up and said .
*MOT: my dummy .
*MOT: and I says .
*MOT: no sure you dont take a dummy anymore .
*MOT: youre a big girl .
*INV: thats brilliant .
*MOT: and she came off it so easily .
*MOT: she really did .
*INV: thats brilliant .
*MOT: I especially really worried .
*MOT: because Peter was really worried when we were going to hafta .
*MOT: you know not just giving her it whenever she wanted or .
*MOT: it wasnt even whenever she wanted .
*MOT: it was whenever I really didnt see it in her mouth .
*INV: laughs .
*MOT: you know it was getting to the stage .
*MOT: I was looking for it and giving it to her .
*INV: yes it was funny .
*INV: because I had always thought I didnt want ours to have a dummy .
*INV: but and they all sucked their thumbs .
*INV: well Patrick sucked his fingers .
*INV: but youre right though .
*INV: with a dummy you can get rid of it .
*INV: I mean all my friends just had ones with dummies .
*INV: and they just got it went in the end .
*MOT: yes yes yes uhhuh .
*INV: but you cant do that with a thumb .
*MOT: but this is true isnt it ?
*INV: yes well Patricks just two fingers .
*INV: so hes got a blanket as well .
*MOT: oh I see so theres the blanket .
*INV: did you have a blanket ?
*MOT: well probably quite likes her blanket .
*MOT: she would ask for it occasionally .
*MOT: she would .
*MOT: I dont think she was ever really attached to it .
*INV: uhhuh .
*MOT: but for some I think she must just like the comfort of it .
*INV: yes .
*MOT: because now and again she would ask me to get it for her when shes .
*MOT: and I know I thought I would have preferred them without dummies .
*MOT: I thought that a dummy was terrible looking you know stuck .
*INV: yes yes yes I know .
*MOT: but after I had her she was a terrible you know child .
*MOT: she just cried constantly for about the first ten weeks .
*INV: aw !
*MOT: and any children I seen that were looked very content always had a .
*INV: oh right .
*MOT: so I soon changed my mind .
*MOT: oh is that stuck on ?
*INV: aw got some cakes whispers .
*MOT: and what schools your oldest son going to then ?
*INV: hes going to Sulivan or Holywood .
*MOT: oh right .
*INV: hoping for big things there wasnt all this worry last year .
*CHI: I cant get this on .
*INV: just as the exams were coming up he said .
*INV: the way Mark and I look at it is it doesnt really matter what .
*INV: because we can make a fresh start .
*MOT: laughs .
*INV: I felt like saying .
*INV: thats a .
*INV: hes not really fond of school .

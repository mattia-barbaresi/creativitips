what is that on the window
what have you got in your mouth
what is that funny noise
what is Amys number
why are we going fast
why are we not || going
what did || you do
why are || you sulking
why || did || you say || you || are || sulking
where || is || the car
what 0has daddy || got
where can || we go then
why || is Mummy shut || the door
where || is || daddy || going
what is that
what || are || you doing with it
why did he left those out
where || is the flask
what || are || you doing

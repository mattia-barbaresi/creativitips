why 0are you going downstairs like that
why dont they like it
why 0is Postman Pat going out the door
why cant he go round
what is in there
why have you got that plaster on
why dont we change || the car || like that then people can sit here
what are || you doing
what is || that funny noise
why did || you already get dressed
why havent || you brought your these
where || is it gone
where || is || that
where is || the other one
what is that thing under there
who put || it || there
why did they put in there
what is in || here
why have || you got so much peas
where || is || the gravy
why has Amy || got some of || that || on
what are || you doing

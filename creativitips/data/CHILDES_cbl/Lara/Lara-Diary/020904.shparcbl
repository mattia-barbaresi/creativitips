where has Gordon gone
where has moon || gone
where is Amy
where is your baby siting in the back
where has moon || gone
what 0have you got || in || your hand
what 0have you got
what 0have you got || in || your sandwich
what Elsie Grandma done with that
what || is || that funny noise
where is Daddy going
what 0have you got it
where has my towel || gone
what about clothes
what about arms
where has all || the blanket || gone

what is that big black across the beams
what is that
what are my sticking out toes
where || is Mum
how do they go
where || is midwife
where || is || the baby
why || is there no tubby custard
why || are || they outside
why || is that going round
what is that funny noise
what is that funny noise
what is that funny noise
what is that funny noise
what is that
where || is your watch
where || is || my water
why are you taking || your slippers off

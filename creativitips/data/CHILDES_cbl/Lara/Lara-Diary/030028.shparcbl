where has the bottom gone from this lid
how do you do it
how do you || do that bit
why is water in there
why dont || you just pour them || in
why are || you writing something down
where has daddy || gone
where has he || gone
what || is || that
what 0are || you doing
why || 0are || you rubbing your eyes
what have || you done
where has || your wellys || gone

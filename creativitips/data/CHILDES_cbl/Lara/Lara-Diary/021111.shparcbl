where has Daddy gone
where has it || gone
where has they || gone
what about the gate
where does she live
what did you do
what did you say
where || are || you going
where is Mummy || going
where has they || gone
what || is in my room
where has || the doughnuts || gone
what did you do
what did you make
what did you do

why are you standing up
why is the door closed
what is it
where || is Amy
what is this for
what can I do
how can I get down
where || is my biscuit
where || is the pig
how || do || you || do || this
how || do you || do this
which one || do you want
where has || the other || one gone
where || is it
where is that || one gone
where is our list
where || you || are
how did || you || do Amys
how || do you || do these
what is Snow White doing
where is the vomit

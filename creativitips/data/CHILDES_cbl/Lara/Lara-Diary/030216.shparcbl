where has my board gone
who was it
what 0is that
what is that
what is || that

which box
where || is the thing || that rolls
what is that funny noise
what are they dogs called
what is this
what is in here
what is that peeping || noise
where || is that man going
where 0are || the children || gone
what is this black
why || is he tied on
where || is his eyes
where || is his eyes

where || is that || thing || in || his mouth
where || is that thing in || his mouth
what color || is clothes

where || is that wagon || going
why || 0is || it || in || the middle || on there
why || is || it bad
where || is || the horse
where || is the horse || that we saw at || the pub
why have you to wash your hands
why do || you put || it || on || the water

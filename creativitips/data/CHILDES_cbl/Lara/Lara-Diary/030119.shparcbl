where is the blue gate
where is Jim
what did you do
why are they outside shoes
what have || you bought
why are || you asleep
why are they dancing
why has Amy got a dress on
why are || you not letting me play with them
what 0is that funny noise
where is my pizza
where is your bit
why || is || Amy having biscuit
what 0are || you doing
why are || you putting || a bib || on her

I brought || one || down || I think somewhere
where || is || it
oh
its || here
do || you want || the Tale || of Tom kitten
right
once upon || a || time || there || were || three || little kittens || called Mittens
they || had || dear || little fur coats || of their own
they tumbled || about || the doorstep || and played || in || the dust
but || one day their mother Mrs Tabitha Twitchet expected friends || for
so || she fetched || the kittens indoors || to wash || and dress || them before
first || she scrubbed || their faces
this ones Moppet
then || she brushed || their fur
this ones Mittens
then || she combed || their tails || and whiskers
this is Tom kitten
Tom || was || very naughty || and he scratched
who
Tom
he || was naughty
Mrs Tabitha dressed Moppet || and Mittens || in || clean pinafores || and
Tom kitten || was || very fat || and hed grown
several buttons burst || off
his mother sewed || them || on || again
when || the || three kittens || were || ready Mrs Tabitha unwisely turned || them
now keep || your frocks || clean children
you must walk || on || your hind || legs
keep || away from || the || dirty ash pit || and || from Sally Henny Penny || and || the
I think || Amys woken || up
shall || I || get || her
I 0will || come || with || you
okay
hello
shall we || go || and || read || Tom kitten || to || all || our babies
this is || my baby
this is || my baby
shall we || read || a story || to || them
yes
my babys Sattoc
your babys || what
my babys || called Sattoc
Sicko
Sattoc
Sattoc
yes
right
right
here || we || are || then
Moppet || and Mittens walked || down || the garden path unsteadily
presently || they trod upon || their pinafores || and fell || on || their noses
when || they stood || up || there || were several green smears
lets climb climb || up || on || the rockery || and || sit || on || the garden
said Moppet
they turned || their pinafores || back || to front || and went || up || with || a skip
Moppets || white tucker fell || down || into || the road
Tom kitten || was quite unable || to jump || when walking upon his hind legs
he came || up || the rockery || by degrees
breaking || the ferns || and shedding buttons || right || and || left
he || was || all || in pieces || when || he reached || the bottom || of || the wall
Moppet || and Mittens tried || to pull him together
his hat || fell || off || and || the rest || of || his buttons burst
oh
laughs
while || they || were || in difficulties || there || was || a pit pat paddle pat
dont || be silly || Lara
and || three Puddle Ducks came along || the har high road marching || one
pit pat paddle pat
pit pat paddle pat
theyre geese arent || they
yes
they || are
no
yes
they || are
yes
they || are
theyre Puddle Ducks
theyre
oh || alright then
theyre Puddle Ducks
youre || right
theyre ducks
theyre ducks
they stopped || and stood || in || a || row || and stared || up || at || the kittens
they || had || very small eyes || and looked surprised
and || the || two || duck birds Rebecca || and Jemina Puddle Duck picked || up || the
Mittens laughed || so much || that || she || fell || off || the wall
Moppet || and || Tom descended after || her
the pinafores || and || all || the rest || of Toms clothes || came || off || on || the way
come Mr Drake || Puddle Duck
said Moppet
come || and || help || us || to dress him
come || and button || up || Tom
Mr Drake Puddle Duck advanced || in || a slow sideways manner || and picked
but || he || put them || on himself
they fitted him even worse than || Tom kitten
its || a || very fine morning
said Mr Drake Puddle Duck
and he || and Jemina || and Rebecca || Puddle Duck set || off || at || the road
pit pat paddle pat
pit pat waddle || pat
then Tabitha Twitchet || came || down || the garden || and || found || her || kittens || on
bet || she || was cross
she pulled || them || off || the wall
smacked || them
and took || them || off || to || the || house
my friends || will arrive || in || a minute || and || you are || not fit || to be seen
I am affronted
said Mrs Tabitha Twitchet
she sent || them upstairs || and || Im || sorry || to || say || she told || her friends
which || was || not true
quite || the contrary
they || were || not || in bed
not || in || the least
somehow || there || were || very extraordinary noises overhead || which
and || I think || that someday || I || shall || hafta || make || another larger || book || to
as || for || the || Puddle Ducks || they went onto || a pond
the clothes || all || came || off || because || there || were || no buttons
and Mr Drake Puddle Duck || and Jemima || and Rebecca || have been || looking
and || thats || the end

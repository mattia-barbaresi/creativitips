get || him || out
but || Stuart watched || it
then || you know || he || and || I || can || say Stuartq
being pulled || out
you || could actually || like || see yourself || all opened || up || and all

because || Im || not flat
you || would || just apparently || you || just
Stuart watched || it
mummie
yes || he says || they || just pulled
he || said
but || can || you || not || see || all || your organs || and everything || and all || as well
I dont || know
I dont || know
I was last week
did || you || not video || it
we asked || to take || the camera || in
and then || in || the end || we decided || not || to
wed || actually asked || the fella || who || was || going to
and || he says
yes || but || only || when || I || tell || you || you can record
youre || not allowed || to record || the cutting || or anything
the baby lifted || out || and then || the cameras off again
so || he was going || like || this
and then || he looks || up || and || says
you can turn || the camera || on || now
you see || a chinese man
so || you || got || it
you || actually || got || it
no || we || didnt || take || it || in
you didnt || do || it
so || and || um
for goodness sake
you see || my whole ribs || and all || were bruised || this time
because || um || I || could feel || them hauling || and pulling
and || I says
Stuart || Im || off || the table
they || were || pulling || him || so hard || I could
I was lifting || off || the table
and || I knew || I was lifting off || the table although || I couldnt || feel
you || were lying || there || and
yes
them pulling || you
yes
and making || you || go || with || them
yes
youre || here || up || all || the times
and then || you see || he must || have || been stuck || or something
because || the || wee doctor || who || was || down || there || actually || come || right || up || to
up || all || the time
and || you see || my whole ribs || they were
yes
they were || all bruised
oh Tanya
but
funny || you never || think || like || that
I always thought || it || would || just || be || like kinda || up || and || out
youve || to pull || them || the whole || way || out || like
youve || to pull || them || out
you see || that || I thought || you || just lifted || them || out || but
so || did || I
you pull || them || out
was || it || him
no || it || was || him
his hip || was stuck
and || they || actually pulled || his
I mean || if || its awkward || you know
pulling
mhm
his hip || was stuck
so || its || really || not easy || is || it
no || I mean || youre || just lying || there
you kind || of || just || think || like || its || like literally || just || a quick

and then || he says || to || me
Im putting || a drain || in || this time
they || put || a hole || right || there || in || my stomach || with || a big drain || in

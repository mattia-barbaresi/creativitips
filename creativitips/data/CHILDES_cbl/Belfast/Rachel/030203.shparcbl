you see || that || was || the funny thing

oh || yes || like || in playschool
a toy library
toy library || yes yes
gosh || thats super || isnt || it

and || its head || and || its || two || wee hands
aw || gosh || how many weeks || are || you || now
twenty || one
aw || yes || and || whats || it || going to be
is || it || going to be || a boy baby || or || a girl baby || do || you think
girl baby
a boy || a boy baby
girl baby
oh || right || oh right
so || you asked || then
no || no || no || they say || they || have || a notice || up saying || not || to ask
because || they cant || be || sure
oh || do || they
oh || thats interesting || yeah
because || it helps || to avoid disappointment
because || its || not || a hundred percent positive || like
thats right || yes
I wouldnt ask anyhow
no || I || didnt wanna || know
I || just || really || didnt wanna || know
youre || just || like our boys
our boys || just wanted another || boy
I dont know what Id || have done || if Id brought home || a girl
is || that || right
I dont know
I would || quite || like || a girl || though
but Peter || would quite || like || a boy
just whatever || you || have || isnt || it
och || I know
so || I || really wanted || a girl || really || really
laughs
why
I || just || think girls || look nicer || in pink
because once || they || get || to || a certain age || I dont mind
but || baby girls || I prefer than || baby boys
I mean once || theyre toddlers || boys || are || lovely || as well || but
they always say || youre better starting || with || a girl || too
because || theyre more sensible
and || they || they || dress || sort of
we || did || it wrong
I think girls || are || quite
well || my friends || got || two || boys || and || a girl
you know || the || boys || are || about || three || and five
and || the || girls || about || a || year || and || a half
and she || is || so || good || just || as || good || as gold
and || the || two boys || are mad mad
but || theyre || just || different arent || they
I know || I would never || have believed || the difference || there || is
I know
but having
my friend across || the road || shes || got || a || wee || boy whos || about || a
and shes due || her second || baby next week
uhhuh
and hes hes pretty wild
you know || I kept saying once || he gets || over || a year hell || be okay
yes || and then || it || just gets worse instead || of || it
and then || we || say probably once || he gets || to || two hell || be okay
well || thats || the || thing
I mean basically || you || have
I mean || I was
shes || yeah || shes || very good
shes || no trouble || at || all
well || Ive || got || a little || girl || this || week
Patricks || got || a || wee || friend staying || with him
oh || has || he
hes friends || up || in Ballycastle
so weve || got || a girl || in || the house
I know
thats || the way || I feel || as well
I dont || think Ill || know what || to || do || with || a boy
you know || not || know || sort of || what || things hed || be interested || in
even || boys toys || are || a bit boring || as well || like arent || they
well Robert || our middle || one || is || really || into Action Man || at || the
and Thomas || really winds him || up || and || says
oh || its || just hes || into dolls
laughs
and hes || just || the same || really || because || I mean || its || all guns || and
they || all sound || really macho
but || hes hes eight
and he || still sucks his thumb
and || so || he took || a bribe || on || over || the summer
so || he || got || so || many points each day || that || he || didnt suck his thumb
anyway || he || got enough points || to get || an Action Man
oh || thats great
so || he spent || all last week trying || to decide which || one || he || was || going
he kept looking || to go || to || the shop
but || at least || hes stopped sucking || his thumb
because || hes || getting || to || the age || really
you know || its || really affected || his || big teeth
I know || yeah || I know
well || I mean || when || Rachel || was born || she wouldnt || take || a dummy
and || I tried || to give || her || a dummy
but || she || didnt || want || it
but || she || was || getting || to || the stage || where || she || was sucking || her thumb
so || then || I tried || her || with || the dummy again || when || she || was || about four
and she || took || it || then
yes || oh || thats
and then || she became || really addicted
would || she || still || take || the dummy
no || no || no
and she came off || it || so easily
I mean || I thought || she || so addicted || to || it || that || would
yeah || yeah
but || it wasnt
she || just lost || it || one day
and normally || I would || have || went || out straight || out || and || got || her || another
um || but || I says
no || Ill try || her || in bed tonight without || it || and || see how || it goes
and she || never asked || for || it
is || that || right
so || I says
she || didnt ask || for || it || last night
so shell || not || you know
thats fantastic || isnt || it
so || just || after || that || it was || just occasionally maybe || if || she
she || would || have woken || up || and said
my || dummy
and || I says
no || sure || you || dont || take || a dummy anymore
youre || a big || girl
thats brilliant
and she came off || it || so easily
she || really || did
thats brilliant
I especially || really worried
because Peter || was || really worried || when || we were || going to || hafta
you know || not || just giving || her || it whenever || she || wanted || or
it wasnt even whenever || she wanted
it was whenever || I || really || didnt || see || it || in || her mouth
laughs
you know || it was || getting || to || the stage
I was looking || for || it || and giving || it || to || her
yes || it was funny
because || I had always || thought || I || didnt want ours || to || have || a dummy
but || and || they || all sucked || their thumbs
well Patrick sucked || his || fingers
but || youre || right || though
with || a dummy || you can || get rid || of || it
I mean || all || my friends || just || had || ones || with dummies
and || they || just || got || it || went || in || the end
yes yes yes uhhuh
but || you cant || do || that || with || a || thumb
but || this || is true || isnt || it
yes || well Patricks || just || two || fingers
so || hes || got || a blanket || as well
oh || I || see || so || theres || the blanket
did || you || have || a blanket
well probably || quite likes || her blanket
she || would || ask || for || it occasionally
she || would
I dont think || she || was ever || really attached || to || it
uhhuh
but || for || some || I think || she must || just || like || the comfort || of || it
yes
because || now || and || again || she would ask || me || to get || it || for her || when || shes
and || I know || I thought || I would || have preferred || them without dummies
I thought || that || a dummy || was terrible || looking || you know stuck
yes yes yes || I know
but || after || I had || her || she || was || a terrible || you know child
she || just cried constantly || for || about || the first ten weeks
aw
and || any || children || I seen || that || were looked || very content always || had || a
oh right
so || I soon changed || my mind
oh || is || that stuck || on
aw || got || some cakes whispers
and || what schools || your oldest son || going to || then
hes || going to Sulivan || or Holywood
oh right
hoping || for || big || things || there || wasnt || all || this worry || last year
I cant || get || this || on
just || as || the exams || were coming || up || he || said
the way Mark || and || I || look at || it || is || it doesnt || really matter || what
because || we || can make || a fresh start
laughs
I felt || like || saying
thats || a
hes || not || really fond || of || school
hes || not
Im || just hoping || that new environment || and new teachers || will || all
you know maybe itll perk him || up || a bit
well || its sposta || be || a || very good || school || the High || isnt || it
it || is || och || it || is || yes
and || we || actually || all our babysitters lived || and || go || there
yeah || yeah
type || of || girls
yeah || uhhuh
and Ive never heard anyone || say || anything || bad || about || it which || is
because || most schools || you know || you hear
you || always hear || something
thats true
and he seems || very satisfied || with || it
so || I hope
its || lovely || isnt || it
I know
so wait || to || we || see
its || just || nice || to || have || the holidays || isnt || it
I || sort of feel rested
I know
Ive || not || been nagging || with them || to get || into || their pajamas anymore
its ten oclock
and || it doesnt matter
I know
ah God
so || their lives || have || been || a || great || thing
theyve || been || having || a || really good || time
and then || they || dont seem || to || think || that || having friends || over || will
oh || thats || good

and || Matthew threw || that much || of || a fit || she || hadta || go into church || and
Bill || says
I dont believe || that
Christmas party || in Jacks bowling club || I || was raging || Cathy
in || a || way || I felt || like saying
dont || you dare || t
my sons || only || the same age || as || him
mhm
I || was angry
yes
and || I thought
no || thats || the way || they || have || Matthew
what happened
Bill || there || was || a bouncy castle
and w || Conor || was running || round bouncing || on || the || castle || you know
and || Bill lifted || him
and || there || was || another || one || with || an entrance || Cathy || big bouncy
uhhuh
there || was nobody || in || it
and || Bill lifted || Conor || like || this
and || there || he || was
one || two three
and then || our Conor || went || in
and he || got || up || and || was giving || it || all || this
and || here || was Jack
right || Matthew || one || two
then set || him || down || you know || like || a wee baby
aye || uhhuh || uhhuh
so || the next || thing || I bought || them crisps
and || me || and || Maggie || were rightly || Cathy
uh white wine white wine
laughs
see || as soon || as || them || two || went || to || get || the kids || to || see Santy || me
I mean || it || was || like || brilliant
and || I really enjoyed || it
och || yeah
but || uh Jack || came || back
and || I says
theres || a wee packet || of crisps || for || the kids
and || our Conor opened || his
and he || was || you know || all excited || and running || about
um Jack || has || Matthew || up onto || his knee || sitting || there
open || your || wee crisps
you know || like || a wee || two || baby
yeah || the way || you || would || with || her
uhhuh
giving || him || wee crisps
and || there || he || was || all
our Conor comes || up || to || see || him
and || Conor
hi || Matthew || are || you coming || to get || on || the bouncy castle
he was || told
no || Matthew || is || sitting || on Daddys knee eating || his || crisps
as || if || to || say
well || you || go up || now
s || here || was || our Conor || at || me
here || was || me
go || on || you || on son
Ill || Ill || come || over || and || see || you || on || the bouncy castle
he sorta looked || at || me || I || as || if || to say
so does Jack mollycoddle || him too || then
Bill || says || theyre || gonna make || a big nancy boy || out || of || that || wee cub
yeah
Jack
so || they || are dear || love || him
but || what worries || me || Sylvia || was || that || that || wee boy
theyre making || him
Maggie || says || she doesnt || want || him || to be || a loner
but || theyre || doing || it
its themins || thats || doing || it
I know
it || is
its || terrible
its || really awful
because || I || was taking || Conor
I didnt || say || to || Maggie
join || the anchor boys
she says
well || I maybe || its || because || you || take || Conor || to || them things || that
and || I says
Maggie || at || the end || of || the || day || its || his personality
but || its only || thats || what || I
whether || you || took || him || or || not
exactly || it depends || on || your personality
uhhuh
and || she felt || that || it || was || really important || that || he || did || all these
and || I said || to || her
youd maybe || be better || to || wait until || hes || a wee bit older || until
whats || the point || of || going || him
hes more sense
and || hes || well settled || in school
and || hes more sense
he wants || his Mommy
because || youre || only torturing || him || doing || that || at || the moment
theres || no point
Conors ready || for || it
uhhuh
well || if || he hadnt || been
Conor || is ready
I wouldnt waste || my time taking || him || Cathy
exactly
Matthews || not ready
uhhuh
so || then th || when || we were || coming || out || um || the fella Trevor
uh || s || uh Missus || theres football anchor boys
and || I says
right || well || his Daddy || can bring || him || down || to || it
so || I says
Conor || do || you wanna || go || to football
thank || you || love
Conors yesq
so || Bill || took || him || down || on Thursday night
and || Bill near || took || that || door || down || when || he || came back
and tw || he || says
when Matthews || with || Conor || if || Conor sees || Matthew || not || doing
and he || says
got || him || and || just threw || him || in || like || that
and h || I says
whats wrong
Bill || just wants || him || to be || a footballer
he || says thatq
here he was || and || him || and || I says
dont || you dare
I says || that || hes || gonna || be || a nancy
and || I says
dont || say || that
because hell || say || that
he || says
that || there
Daddy || he wont kick || the ball || to || me
he wont kick || the b
I says
leave || him alone
hes || only || a four || year old
at least || hes || hes || out || doing || it
I know
Bill wanted || him || to be able || to tackle || and || all
och || I know
but || och || I mean || well || thats ridiculous || like
but || you know || what || I mean
uhhuh || and || I says || to him
och || away || you || and catch yourself || on
he || says
thats || you || has || him || like || that
remember || I told || you || about || the football
och Daddy || no || I dont || wanna kick || it
wipe || the dirt || off || it
laughs
laughs
and he was fuming
I know
but || thats || them || you see
thats || them || you see
thats
I says
och || leave || him alone
no
I says || to || Conor
Bill || went || up || the stairs
I says
you || tell || your Daddy || dont w
its only Millie boys play football
you wanna || go h
I || only || said || it || for badness
I know
I know
just || like || with horse riding
and || Conor || says || when || he came downstairs
and || Bill || went || got || him
and Bill looked || at || me
and || I turned || my head
and he was
here || was || Bill
who || told || you || to say || that
and || here he was
my || Mommy
laughs
I says
I || was || only keeping || him || going
he does
hes || going || to football || next Thursday
I know
but || Matthew || he || says
Sylvia || that child || wouldnt even || leave || t stop || sitting || on Jacks
and he || did
he || got || up || on || last Tuesday || and marched
but || theres nothing wrong || with || a child || sitting || on || its Daddys
uhhuh
thats || not || the point
its || just || that || theyre
you can || just || see how || much
its too overpowering
its too overbearing
you || dont || want || them || to grow || up
the trouble || is || not admitting || that || he has || a problem
and || thats || what worries || me || more than anything
because
at || the very least
Ill tell || you whats happened
it || has slipped through || the system
because obviously || the health visitor || has || come || out
when || you need || them
and || the health visitor || has || said
and theyve washed || their hands || of || it
uhhuh || s || just exactly || and theyve || said || to themselves
well || Im not || gonna || sit || here || and coax || this || wee boy || to
uhhuh
and || the mothers || not
exactly
and || the mothers || not interested
shes || not || in || uhhuh
so || its slipped through || the system
and || whats || gonna happen || is || that || in nursery school theyve || said || to
uhhuh
and || s || she says || things || like
um || well || they || told || me || that || hes beginning || to say
uhhuh
you know what || I mean
you know what || I mean
och || I know
sure || shes asked
shed || shes || at || that stage || now
uhhuh
you know what || I mean
not || a wee boy || thats || like || like four || on Tuesday
didnt || I tell || you || about || the centre || down || in Whiteabbey
so anyway || what || I said || to her || was
no
last || year
she || told || me || something || about || it
and then || she
Maggie
she says
och || its half eleven || in the morning
what || do || you expect
hes || not woke
but || I mean || the child || never sleeps
so why || can || he || not || be woke
thats ridiculous
and || she says
Maggie || was standing || over || like this
and || the man || says
Matthew || whats || what || is || this
uhhuh
s || and || the man || says
Matthew || what || is || this
and heres || Maggie
here || here || dont || you speak || to || my
here
yeah
so || what || do || you
I mean
yeah
sh || she || wont admit || it
to || just || say
she will || not admit || that || he has || a problem
catch yourself || on
and || the stupid || thing || about || it || is || that youd || think || her husband || would
him being || a teacher || and everything
yeah
he should || know
he should || know what problems || that || wee boys || gonna || have
and || theyre
we || went || out home || Sylvia
they || thought
they thought
theyre || gonna make || so || much || more || of || him
because || his father || is
yes || but || whats || he g || to || school || in September
he wont
hes || not || gonna slip through || the system || then
because || in || come September || theyre || gonna hafta || do || big || stuff
whereas || if shed || got || him || through th || at three || it || wouldnt || have
I mean Maggies h || Maggie thinks || because || he || can || do || a jigsaw
and || I says || to her || my sister || didnt speak || until || she || was || two || and || a
well || what || I said || to her || was
shes || two || and || a half || and || shes
what || I said || to her || was
he || cant || say sentences
do || this
you know
which || you should || when || youre || about || two
you || get || them || at || about || two
I mean || were looking || at || all these || really complex || things
what || would || you do
och || you know
so || I says || to her
all || I said || to her || was
um || well || Maggie
I said
um || I g || all || Ive || said || is
och || well || Maggie || Maggie || you know
but || the other || day || there || when || I said || to her
you || just
she || said
I thought || that || she told || her
I didnt || wanna || leave || it || you see
I || wanna || say || something || to her
uhhuh
but || a || he has || a problem
uhhuh
I know
theyve || so much || to contend || with || when || they || go into P One || with || all
that || wee boy || is || gonna || have enough || to deal || with without having
hows || that child || even || gonna
Cathy || when || they start P One || what time || do || they || stay || to

they || just || hafta || go || in || and th theyll make || him cry
theyll make || them cry || Sylvia || from th || then || to || Christmas || if
because || thats || what || they || do
theres || no mollycoddling || them
hows || he || gonna manage || to || tell || the teacher || he
well || I mean || at || the end || of || the || day || thats || what || Maggies asking || for
thats || what || shes asking || for
uhhuh
if
its || her fault
she thinks || just || one || day || hes || gonna wake || up || and || be able || to speak
its serious
the way || shes || saying || about Amy || not speaking || until || she || was || two || and
she thinks || hes || gonna || get || a masters degree || because
I dont know || if || it || was || me
shes ignoring || it
because sh || shes letting || on || that || it doesnt exist
she doesnt || wanna || know || Cathy
but || she || just || says || I || I mean
thats ridiculous
that || is || ridiculous
like || like || an eighteen month old || baby

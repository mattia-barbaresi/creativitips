I || do
to live || in || a lighthouse must || be very strange
mm
why || would || it || be strange
well || the shape || of || a lighthouse || I mean || to || get || to || the top youd
Ive been || in || a lighthouse || at Scarborough
and || there || you hafta || go round || and || round || as || youre
right || to || the top || and || its || very tall || a lighthouse
my cat || would || get tired || and tired || and
mm
I dont think Purdie || would || like || to live || in || a lighthouse || because || you

when people lived || in || them || but somethings happened || now || and || I cant
I dont know whether people || dont live || in || them || any || more
you see || the || lighthouse keeper || it || would || have || been || very hard
saying || that he he shined lights || to warn ships || that || they were

I dont think people || hafta stay || in lighthouses || any more
so those || have computers

theyre || not || good || are || they somethings happened || to || them
you || have || fire engines || at ordinary airports though || dont || you

well || the || thing || is || Thomas
how many times || has || Mummy told || you about jumping || on || the sofa
its alright doing || little jumps || but || you || do great big jumps
and || youre || going to fall || off || one || day
and youre || going to really hurt yourself
and apart || from falling || off || the settee if || you || go forwards youll
I 0am hiding under || the settee
whos hiding under || the settee
me
Thomas
no
I dont || think || you can || get underneath || the settee
you can || go behind || it || but || you cant || go underneath
its too low || down
its perfect || for losing Lego bricks || and things || like || that underneath
its too small || for || you
but || the other || thing || Thomas
Mummy cleans || up everyday
and || I straighten || the cushions || and || get || it all looking || nice
and if || youre jumping || on || it especially || with shoes || its || not nice
people hafta || sit || down || on || that
so || Mummy kept telling || you || not || to jump || on || the sofa
Daddy kept telling || you || not || to || do || it || and || you carried || on doing || it
so || Daddy || got very || very cross || didnt || he
yes
so || you better || not || do || it again
because || if || he || has warned || you || and || you keep || doing || it || then || I dont
what || do you || think hell || do
I dont know
he might || say || no more chocolate ever ever again
and then youd be upset wouldnt || you
yes
you || would
thats exactly || what youd || say
so || just || think || on
it always happens || Thomas
you || you || do || things
youre asked || not || to || do things || and then || you || do || it
and then something happens
and then || we explain || thats why || we told || you || in || the first place || not
its only || because || I love || you
um
its || like || the settee
if || you || youre jumping || on || the settee || and || you fall || off || and hurt
I dont || like || to || see || you || getting hurt
its all part || of
look
a ladder

look
a ladder
a ladder || say bang

they fall || over || and || say bang || dont || they
and then || you || get || hurt
its all part || of growing || up darling
youll || do || lots of || things
